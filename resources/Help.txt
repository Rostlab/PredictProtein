  WHAT IS IT? HOW TO USE?
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is PredictProtein (PP)?

PP is an automatic service for protein database searches and the prediction
of aspects of protein structure. You send an amino acid sequence and PP
returns:

  1. a multiple sequence alignment (i.e. database search),
  2. ProSite sequence motifs (more info),
  3. ProDom domain assignments (more info),
  4. and predictions of
       1. secondary structure (more info),
       2. solvent accessibility (more info),
       3. globular regions ( more info),
       4. transmembrane helices (more info),
       5. coiled-coil regions ( more info).

The following features are available upon request:

  1. fold recognition by prediction-based threading (more info):
     PDB is searched for possible remote homologues (sequence identity
     0-25%) to your sequence,
  2. evaluation of prediction accuracy (more info):
     for a given predicted and observed secondary structure (for one or
     several proteins), per-residue and per-segment scores are compiled.

For all services, you can submit your sequence (or prediction) either by
electronic mail, or interactively from World Wide Web.

How does PredictProtein work?

Generating an alignment. The following steps are performed.

  1. the sequence database (currently only SWISSPROT) is scanned for similar
     sequences (by BLASTP).
  2. a multiple sequence alignment is generated by a weighted dynamic
     programming method (by MaxHom).
  3. ProSite motifs are retrieved from the ProSite database,
  4. and your protein is compared to a domain database (ProDom).

Prediction of protein structure in 1D. The multiple alignment is used as
input for profile-based neural network predictions (PHD methods). The
following levels of prediction accuracy have been evaluated in
cross-validation experiments:

  1. Secondary structure prediction (PHDsec):
     expected three-state (helix, strand, rest) overall accuracy >72% for
     water-soluble globular proteins.
     You may find details about accuracy in graphs, on tables, and in the
     literature: Rost 1997 (paper) and 1996 (paper); Rost & Sander 1993
     (abstract) and 1994 (abstract).
  2. Solvent accessibility prediction (PHDacc):
     expected correlation between observed and predicted relative
     accessibility > 0.5.
     You may find details about accuracy in graphs, on tables, and in the
     literature: Rost 1997 (paper) and 1996 (paper), Rost & Sander 1994
     (abstract).
  3. Transmembrane helix prediction (PHDhtm):
     expected overall two-state accuracy (transmembrane, non-transmembrane)
     > 95%; refined prediction of transmembrane helices and topology &
     expected likelihood of predicting all helices correctly about 89%,
     expected accuracy of topology prediction > 86%
     You may find details about accuracy on tables, and in the literature:
     Rost, Casadio & Fariselli 1996 (abstract), and Rost, Casadio, Fariselli
     & Sander 1995 abstract).

Fold recognition by prediction-based threading. Predictions of secondary
structure and accessibility are aligned against PDB to detect remote
homologues (prediction-based threading). As for other threading methods,
results should be taken with caution.

   * The first hit of the prediction-based threading is on average in 30% of
     the cases correct.
   * Hits with z-scores above 3.0 are more reliable (accuracy > 60%).
   * For exceptional cases the resulting alignments suffice for building
     correct homology-based models.

You may find details about accuracy in the literature: Rost, Schneider &
Sander, 1996 (paper), Rost 1995 (abstract) and 1994 (abstract).

Evaluation of prediction accuracy. If you opt for 'evaluate prediction
accuracy', we evaluate the accuracy of the secondary structure prediction
provided by you. The following per-residue and per-segment scores are
returned: overall three-state accuracy, single state accuracy, correlation
coefficients, information entropy, fractional segment overlap, and finally
the accuracy of predicting secondary structure content and structural class
(Rost et al., JMB, 1994, 235, 13-26, example for output).

What can we do for you?

   * You have a protein sequence and want to find out anything we can say
     about structure?
     In general, we can provide multiple sequence alignments and predictions
     of secondary structure, residue solvent accessibility and the location
     of transmembrane helices (examples for: request; and output).
   * You have a helical transmembrane protein sequence and want a refined
     prediction of the helix locations and topology?
     We provide multiple sequence alignments and refined predictions for the
     location of transmembrane helices and for the topology, i.e. the
     orientation of the N-term with respect to the membrane (examples for:
     request; and output).
   * You have a protein sequence and search for remote homologues (i.e.,
     homologues with <25% sequence identity)?
     We find secondary structure and accessibility motifs similar between a
     known structure and your protein by prediction-based threading
     (examples for: request; and output).
   * You have a multiple sequence alignment and want to obtain a prediction
     of 1D structure based on that alignment?
     We use your alignment as input to the methods predicting secondary
     structure, solvent accessibility and transmembrane helices (examples
     for: request; and output).
   * You have a list of sequences not in current data bases and want it to
     be used for 1D predictions?
     We align your sequences and use the resulting alignment as input to
     predictions of secondary structure, accessibility and transmembrane
     helices (examples for: request; and output).
   * You have a prediction of secondary structure and accessibility and
     search similar motifs in known structures?
     We base the threading procedure on your prediction (examples for:
     request; and output).
   * You have a prediction and an observation of secondary structure and you
     want to compile the prediction accuracy?
     We compile per-residue and per-segment based score for the evaluation
     of prediction accuracy (examples for: request; and output).

Comment: if you find the following list too long, please note that
PredictProtein combines a large number of independent tools. Where other
servers adopt the philosophy 'one mail/WWW interface per tool' (for a few
examples), PP attempts to provide one single interface to many tools. Many
of the tools are at the forefront of bio-informatics (academics may 'pay'
these services by quoting).

Default output

The output format is self-documenting (examples given for the major prion
protein precursor prio_human (all,phd only) and the known 3D structure of
HIV protease 1hhp). The output contains:

  1. A list of likely homologues found in the protein database (SWISSPROT),
     and the multiple sequence alignment of these sequence (by default in
     'MSF' format)
  2. If found: a list of the putative ProSite motifs.
  3. If found: a list of ProDom domain assignments.
  4. If found: a prediction of coiled-coil regions.
  5. Information about the expected levels of accuracy of structure
     predictions. (We suggest that newcomers read this carefully.)
  6. Prediction of aspects of protein structure. These are grouped in the
     following way:
       1. Prediction of secondary structure for all residues, with an
          expected average three-state accuracy of > 72%;
       2. Prediction of secondary structure for reliably scored residues
          only, with an expected three-state accuracy for these residues of
          > 82%;
       3. Prediction of solvent accessibility for all residues, with an
          expected average correlation to the experimentally observed values
          of 0.54;
       4. Prediction of solvent accessibility for reliably scored residues
          only, with an expected correlation between experimental
          observation and prediction of 0.69;
       5. Prediction of transmembrane helices and their topology (if any
          detected), with an expected prediction accuracy of about 95% in
          two states.

Note: for the prediction of transmembrane helices a conservative threshold
is chosen. Thus, your protein may not be reported to contain a HTM although
it may have one. If you opt explicitly for the refined prediction of
transmembrane helices and topology ("predict htm"), four predictions are
given (example for output)):

  1. neural network prediction (expected accuracy for HTM's about 78%);
  2. result of empirical filter (expected accuracy for HTM's about 97%);
  3. refined prediction (expected accuracy for HTM's about 99%);
  4. prediction of topology (expected accuracy about 86%).

Example for input and output (important for email submission)

Submitting a single sequence

   * INPUT is: your protein sequence,
   * OUTPUT is: alignment + prediction

INPUT
You send the following file:
joe@amino.churn.edu
# incredulase from paracoccus dementiae, translated from cDNA
KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKD
WWKVEVNDRQGFVPAAYVKKLD

Notes:

   * The '#' is a control for PredictProtein.
   * The hash (#) is crucial, as the parser interprets anything after this
     line as a protein sequence. Following the hash, put a one-line
     description of the protein.

OUTPUT (detailed example)
If your sequence has at least one non-trivial homologue in the database of
protein sequences, you receive a multiple sequence alignment and the
annotated prediction in the following form:
Block with multiple sequence alignment.
Block with explanations about the prediction method.
Block with prediction (example for secondary structure prediction follows).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADVANCED INPUT OPTIONS (FORMATS)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following input options have been implemented:

  1. Use a SWISSPROT identifier ('# SWISSPROT identifier')
     If you provide a valid SWISSPROT identifier (e.g. paho_chick), PP will
     use the respective sequence for prediction.
     Example for email submission format.
  2. Use your unaligned set of sequences ('# FASTA list')
     You can provide sequences that are not yet in the Swissprot database.
     The sequences will be aligned automatically by the program MaxHom; the
     prediction will be based on this alignment. You use the header as
     described before, with "# FASTA list" instead of "# sequence name".
     Then you append all your sequences successively in the PIR format after
     this line.
     Example for email submission format.
  3. Use your unaligned set of sequences ('# PIR list')
     You can provide sequences that are not yet in the Swissprot database.
     The sequences will be aligned automatically by the program MaxHom; the
     prediction will be based on this alignment. You use the header as
     described before, with "# PIR list" instead of "# sequence name". Then
     you append all your sequences successively in the PIR format after this
     line.
     Example for email submission format.
  4. Use your SAF alignment ('# SAF')
     You can provide your alignment input to the PHD predictions. To do so,
     you have to generate a file in SAF (simple alignment format). Then you
     append this file to the same header as described before, with "# SAF"
     instead of "# sequence name".
     Example for email submission format.
  5. Use your MSF alignment ('# MSF')
     You can provide your alignment input to the PHD predictions. To do so,
     you have to generate a file in MSF (multiple sequence format), e.g.,
     generated by the program PILEUP (GCG). Then you append this file to the
     same header as described before, with "# MSF" instead of "# sequence
     name".
     Example for email submission format.
  6. Use your FASTA alignment ('# FASTA list')
     You can submit your alignment in FASTA format. This requires two
     keywords: (1) the string "# FASTA list" prompts the system to interpret
     your alignment as one in the FASTA format (specification and example
     for FASTA list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line
     before the one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment
     will not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences
     via FASTA format).
     Example for email submission format.
  7. Use your PIR alignment ('# PIR list')
     You can submit your alignment in PIR format. This requires two
     keywords: (1) the string "# PIR list" prompts the system to interpret
     your alignment as one in the PIR format (specification and example for
     PIR list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line before
     the one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment will
     not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences via
     PIR format).
     Example for email submission format.
  8. Use your prediction of 1D structure for threading ('# COLUMN format')
     You can provide your prediction of secondary structure and relative
     accessibility. (Both predictions are required. If you don't have, e.g.,
     a prediction of accessibility, use PHDacc to generate it.) Your
     prediction will be used for threading. You use the header as described
     before, with "# COLUMN format" instead of "# sequence name". Then you
     append your prediction in the "COLUMN format" after this line.
     Example for email submission format.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADVANCED PREDICTION OPTIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The following prediction options have been implemented:

  1. Predict only secondary structure ('predict secondary structure')
     The string "predict secondary structure" (or short: "PHDsec") in any
     line before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a prediction
     of secondary structure, only.
  2. Predict only solvent accessibility ('predict accessibility')
     The string "predict accessibility" (or short: "PHDacc") in any line
     before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a prediction of
     solvent accessibility, only.
  3. Predict only transmembrane helices ('predict transmembrane')
     The string "predict transmembrane" (or short: "PHDhtm") in any line
     before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a refined
     prediction of transmembrane helices and topology.

  4. Filtering PHD input alignment (Default)
     If the divergence found in your family is not 'well' spread, prediction
     accuracy may drop. In particular, too many highly similar sequences may
     be problematic in absence of further diverged family members. This
     problem came up only in the post-genome era, i.e. since the number of
     sequences is exploding. To correct for this problem we run a crude
     filter on the alignment, by default. To switch this filter off, please
     use the keyword 'no filter' in any line before the one commencing with
     a hash ('#').

  5. Prediction of coiled coils (Default, example)
     Coiled-coil regions are reported by default, when found. To surpress
     this default, use the string "no coils" in any line before the one
     beginning with a hash (#).
  6. ProSite sequence motifs (Default, example)
     ProSite sequence motifs are reported by default, when found. To
     surppress this default, use the string "no prosite" in any line before
     the one beginning with a hash (#).
  7. ProDom domains (Default, example)
     ProDom domains are reported by default, when found. To surppress this
     default, use the string "no prodom" in any line before the one
     beginning with a hash (#).

  8. Prediction-based threading ('prediction-based threading')
     The string "prediction-based threading" (or short: TOPITS) in any line
     before the one beginning with a hash (#) requests the prediction-based
     threading (TOPITS). If you do not provide 'your prediction' for the
     fold recognition, we return a multiple sequence alignment, a prediction
     of secondary structure and accessibility, and the threading alignment
     of your sequence and possible remote homologues of known structure.
     The results of the search for remote homologues are given in three
     blocks. (1) An MSF formatted (default) alignment between your sequence
     and possible remote homologues. (2) A summary of some statistics such
     as alignment scores for a cross-validation experiment and for your
     request. (3) An alignment presenting the entire motifs of 1D structure
     for the alignment.

  9. Evaluation of secondary structure prediction accuracy (for program
     developers, only!)
     The output consists of two parts: (1) per-residue and per-segment
     scores for each protein in your input file, and (2) per-residue and
     per-segment scores for all proteins in your input file (the latter
     includes scores for the accuracy in predicting secondary structure
     content and secondary structural class; example for output).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADVANCED OUTPUT OPTIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following output options have been implemented (most of the options are
mutually not exclusive, i.e. you can add most of these additional keywords
at the same time).

General output options

  1. Return results in html ('return html')
     The string "return html" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) results in that the email you get will have the entire results
     attached in one HTML formatted file (which you can load into any WWW
     browser).
        o Alignments and ProDom results are displayed using the program
          MView developed by (A
          HREF="http://mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/~nbrown/">Nigel Brown (MRC,
          Mill Hill, London).
        o All other results is still simply converted to a format resembling
          the old output. (I hope that this is going to change soon.)

  2. Return concise output ("return concise")
     The string "return concise result" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) returns a concise summary of results (e.g., no tables
     for prediction accuracy).

Customising alignment

  1. Return also BLASTP output ('return blast')
     The string "return blast" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) returns additionally the unfiltered BLASTP output.
  2. Return no alignment ('return no alignment')
     The string "return no alignment" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) returns no alignment.
  3. Return alignment in MSF format ('return msf' = default return format)
     The string "return msf" in any line before the one starting with a hash
     (#) returns the HSSP/MaxHom alignment in MSF format. (Note: this format
     can be used as input for a request of homology modelling.)
  4. Return alignment in HSSP format without profiles ('return hssp format')

     The string "return hssp format" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) return the HSSP/MaxHom alignment without profiles of
     residue substitution frequencies (default MSF format without profiles).
  5. Return alignment in HSSP format + profiles ('return hssp profiles')
     The string "return hssp profiles" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) return the HSSP/MaxHom alignment including profiles of
     residue substitution frequencies (default MSF format without profiles).

Customising PHD

  1. Return COLUMN format ("return column format")
     The string "return column format" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) returns the secondary structure and accessibility
     prediction in a column format. (Note: this format can be used as input
     for a request of prediction-based threading.)
  2. Return prediction additionally in MSF format ("return phd msf")
     The string "return phd msf" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in an MSF format
     (appended to the alignment).
  3. Return prediction additionally in RDB format ("return phd rdb")
     The string "return phd rdb" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in RDB format (as
     read and written by local versions of the programs PHD and TOPITS).
  4. Return prediction additionally in CASP2 format ("return phd casp2")
     The string "return phd casp2" in any line before the one starting with
     a hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in the format used
     for the second protein structure prediction contest in Asilomar, 1996
     (CASP2).
  5. Return prediction probability for graphical display ("return graph")
     The string "return graph" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) append a file containing the 1D structure prediction in such a
     format that the relative propensities for the prediction of each of the
     output states (e.g. three secondary structure types: helix, strand,
     rest) can be used as input for usual graphics software (if
     appropriately extracted), such as KaleidaGraph, Excel, Mathematica,
     Sigma-Plot, Harvard-Graphics. Example:

     ridiculase (17 residues)
       No,AA,PSEC,RI_S,OtH,OtE,OtL,PACC,PREL,RI_A,Pbie,Ot0,Ot1,..,Ot9

Customising TOPITS

  1. Return topits hssp ("return topits hssp")
     The string "return topits hssp" in any line before the one starting
     with a hash (#) returns the threading output additionally in HSSP
     format.

     The string "return topits own" in any line before the one starting with
     a hash (#) returns the threading output additionally in the format used
     by TOPITS.

Note: the 'return topits' options will hopefully make more sense in the near
future when Sito Pazos (CNB, Madrid) will have finished his interactive
work-bench for viewing the TOPITS output.

Toggle defaults

The following options allow you to toggle (switch) the defaults for ProSite,
ProDom, and Coils.

  1. Return no coils ("return no coils")
     The string "return no coils" in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) results in that COILS results are not returned.
     Note: to explicitly REQUEST Coils predictions use the string "do
     coils".
  2. Return no ProSite ("return no ProSite")
     The string "return no ProSite" in any line before the one starting with

   * The string "# SWISSid" is crucial, as the parser interprets anything
     after this line as a SWISSPROT identifier.
   * Valid identifiers have the form 'name_species', for the example above:
        o name=paho
        o species=chick
   * Only identifiers of the latest SWISSPROT release are accepted.

  PREDICTION METHODS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Multiple sequence alignment (MaxHom)

The multiple sequence alignments is built up in essentially three steps
(MaxHom, Sander & Schneider, Proteins, 1991, 9, 56-68).

  1. The protein database (currently SWISS-PROT) is searched by a fast
     alignment program (currently BLASTP).
  2. In sweep 1, sequences are aligned consecutively to the search sequence
     by a standard dynamic programming method. After each sequence has been
     added a profile is compiled, and used to align the next sequence.
  3. In sweep 2, after all sequences with significant homology have been
     picked from the BLASTP output, the profile is recompiled, and the
     dynamic programming algorithm starts once again to align consecutively
     the sequences, this time using the conservation profile as derived
     after completion of sweep 1.

Functional sequence motifs (ProSite; example for output)

The following description is from the original ProSite site:
ProSite is a method of determining what is the function of uncharacterized
proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. It consists of a
database of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles that help
to reliably identify to which known family of protein (if any) a new
sequence belongs.

Domain assignment (ProDom; example for output)

The following description is from the original ProDom site (which supplies a
rather useful graphical interface to the ProDom database):
The ProDom protein domain database consists of an automatic compilation of
homologous domains detected in the SWISS-PROT database by the DOMAINER
algorithm (ELL Sonnhammer & D Kahn, Prot. Sci., 1994, 3, 482-492). It has
been devised to assist with the analysis of the domain arrangement of
proteins.
ProDom `domains' are inferred on the basis of conserved subsequences as
found in various proteins. Such a conservation corresponds frequently,
though not always, to genuine structural domains: therefore domain
boundaries should be treated with caution. For some domain families experts
have been asked to correct domain boundaries on the basis of both sequence
and structural information. This expertise will complement the automated
process and improve the quality of ProDom domain families.

Secondary structure (PHDsec)

Secondary structure is predicted by a system of neural networks rating at an
expected average accuracy > 72% for the three states helix, strand and loop
(Rost & Sander, PNAS, 1993 , 90, 7558-7562; Rost & Sander, JMB, 1993 , 232,
584-599; and Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994 , 19, 55-72; evaluation of
accuracy). Evaluated on the same data set, PHDsec is rated at ten percentage
points higher three-state accuracy than methods using only single sequence
information, and at more than six percentage points higher than, e.g., a
method using alignment information based on statistics (Levin, Pascarella,
Argos & Garnier, Prot. Engng., 6, 849-54, 1993).
PHDsec predictions have three main features:

  1. improved accuracy through evolutionary information from multiple
     sequence alignments
  2. improved beta-strand prediction through a balanced training procedure
  3. more accurate prediction of secondary structure segments by using a
     multi-level system

Solvent accessibility (PHDacc)

Solvent accessibility is predicted by a neural network method rating at a
correlation coefficient (correlation between experimentally observed and
predicted relative solvent accessibility) of 0.54 cross-validated on a set
of 238 globular proteins (Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994, 20, 216-226;
evaluation of accuracy). The output of the neural network codes for 10
states of relative accessibility. Expressed in units of the difference
between prediction by homology modelling (best method) and prediction at
random (worst method), PHDacc is some 26 percentage points superior to a
comparable neural network using three output states (buried, intermediate,
exposed) and using no information from multiple alignments.

Globularity of proteins (GLOBE)

An additional result from the prediction of solvent accessibility is that of
protein globularity. That method is not published, yet. For more
information, you may have a look at the preliminary preprint.

Transmembrane helices (PHDhtm; example for output)

Transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins are predicted by a
system of neural networks. The shortcoming of the network system is that
often too long helices are predicted. These are cut by an empirical filter.
The final prediction (Rost et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4, 521-533;
evaluation of accuracy) has an expected per-residue accuracy of about 95%.
The number of false positives, i.e., transmembrane helices predicted in
globular proteins, is about 2% (Rost et al. 1996).
The neural network prediction of transmembrane helices (PHDhtm) is refined
by a dynamic programming-like algorithm. This method resulted in correct
predictions of all transmembrane helices for 89% of the 131 proteins used in
a cross-validation test; more than 98% of the transmembrane helices were
correctly predicted. The output of this method is used to predict topology,
i.e., the orientation of the N-term with respect to the membrane. The
expected accuracy of the topology prediction is > 86%. Prediction accuracy
is higher than average for eukaryotic proteins and lower than average for
prokaryotes. PHDtopology is more accurate than all other methods tested on
identical data sets (Rost, Casadio & Fariselli, 1996a and 1996b; evaluation
of accuracy).

Coiled-coil regions (COILS; example for output)

The following description is from the original COILS site:
COILS is a program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel
two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score. By comparing this
score to the distribution of scores in globular and coiled-coil proteins,
the program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a
coiled-coil conformation.

Fold recognition by prediction-based threading (TOPITS; examples for:
request and output)

Remote homologues (0-25% sequence identity) are detected by a novel
prediction-based threading method (Rost 1995a and 1995b). The principle idea
is to detect similar motifs of secondary structure and accessibility between
a sequence of unknown structure and a known fold . For the recognition of
similarities between entire folds, the expected accuracy (first hit of
alignment list correct) is about 60% (Rost, ISMB95 Proceedings, 1995, AAAI
Press, 314-321). If the goal is to correctly detect even short homologous
fragments, still about 30% of the first hits are correct (compared to an
accuracy of 14% for simple sequence alignments: full paper). Hits with
z-scores above 3.0 are more reliable (accuracy > 60%). (Note: a threading
service based on similar principles is provided by Daniel Fischer
(http://www.mbi.ucla.edu/people/frsvr/frsvr.html).

  HINTS FOR USERS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note

The following notes result from the experiences I have gathered by offering,
and running the PredictProtein service and during various structure
prediction workshops. The comments are tailored in particular to the PHD
methods; however, most comments hold also for using other secondary
structure prediction methods.

What can you expect from secondary structure prediction?

How accurate are the predictions ? The expected levels of accuracy (PHDsec =
7211% (three state per-residue accuracy); PHDacc = 757% (two-state
per-residue accuracy); PHDhtm = 946% (two-state per-residue accuracy)) are
valid for typical globular, water-soluble (PHDsec, PHDacc), or helical
transmembrane proteins (PHDhtm) when the multiple alignment contains many
and diverse sequences. High values for the reliability indices indicate more
accurate predictions. (Note: for alignments with little variation in the
sequences, the reliability indices adopt misleadingly high values.) PHDsec
predictions tend to be relatively accurate for porins; however, for helical
membrane proteins other programs ought to be used.

Confusion between strand and helix? PHD (as well as other methods) focuses
on predicting hydrogen bonds. Consequently, occasionally strongly predicted
(high reliability index) helices are observed as strands and vice versa
(expected accuracy of PHDsec).

Strong signal from secondary structure caps? The ends of helices and strands
contain a strong signal. However, on average PHD predicts the core of
helices and strands more accurately than the caps (B. Rost and C. Sander, 1D
secondary structure prediction through evolutionary profiles, in: H. Bohr
and S. Brunak (eds.), Protein Structure by Distance Analysis, Amsterdam: IOS
Press, 257-276 (1994)). This seems to also hold for other methods (Garnier,
priv. comm.).

Are internal helices predicted poorly? Steven Benner has indicated that
internal buried helices are particularly difficult to predict. On average,
this is not the case for PHD predictions (expected accuracy of PHDsec for
buried helices).

Accessibility useful to provide upper limits for contacts? The predicted
solvent accessibility (PHDacc) can be translated into a prediction of the
number of water atoms around a given residue. Consequently, PHDacc can be
used to derive upper and lower limits for the number of inter-residue
contacts of a certain residue (such an estimate could improve predictions of
inter-residue contacts).

How to predict porins? PHDhtm predicts only transmembrane helices, and
PHDsec has been trained on globular, water-soluble proteins. How to predict
1D structure for porins then? As porins are partly accessible to solvent,
prediction accuracy of PHDsec was relatively high (70%) for the known
structures. Thus, PHDsec appears to be applicable.

How to use the prediction of transmembrane helices? One possible application
of PHDhtm is to scan, e.g., entire chromosomes for possible transmembrane
proteins. The classification as transmembrane protein is not sufficient to
have knowledge about function, but may shed some light into the puzzle of
genome analyses. When using PHDhtm for this purpose, the user should keep in
mind that on average about 5% of the globular proteins are falsely predicted
to have transmembrane helices.

What about protein design and synthesised peptides? The PHD networks are
trained on naturally evolved proteins. However, the predictions have proven
to be useful in some cases to investigate the influence of single mutations
(e.g. for Chameleon ), or for Janus, Rost, unpublished). For short
poly-peptides, the following should be taken into account: the network input
consists of 17 adjacent residues, thus, shorter sequences may be dominated
by the ends (which are treated as solvent).

In a nutshell: how to avoid pitfalls?

70% correct implies 30% incorrect. The most accurate methods for predicting
secondary structure reach sustained levels of about 70% accuracy. When
interpreting predictions for a particular protein it is often instructive to
mark the 30% of the residues you suspect to be falsely predicted.

Spread of prediction accuracy. An expected accuracy of 70% does NOT imply
that for your protein U 70% of all residues are correctly predicted.
Instead, values published for prediction accuracy are averaged over hundreds
of unique proteins. An expected accuracy of 7010% (one standard deviation)
implies that, on average, for two thirds of all proteins between 60 and 80%
of the residues will be predicted correctly (expected accuracy of PHDsec).
Thus, prediction accuracy can be higher than 80% or lower than 60% for your
protein. Few methods supply well tested indices for the reliability of
predictions. Such indices can help to reduce or increase your trust in a
particular prediction.

Special classes of proteins. Prediction methods are usually derived from
knowledge contained in subsets of proteins from databases. Consequently,
they should not be applied to classes of proteins which have not been
included in the subsets. For example, methods for predicting helices in
globular proteins are likely to fail when applied to predict transmembrane
helices. In general, results should be taken with caution for proteins with
unusual features, such as proline-rich regions, unusually many cysteine
bonds, or for domain interfaces.

Better alignments yield better predictions. Multiple alignment-based
predictions are substantially more accurate than single sequence-based
predictions. How many sequences do you need in your alignment to expect an
improvement; and how sensitive are prediction methods with respect to errors
in the alignment? The more divergent sequences contained in the alignment,
the better (two distantly related sequences often improve secondary
structure predictions by several percentage points). Regions with few
aligned sequences yield less reliable predictions. The sensitivity to
alignment errors depends on the methods, e.g., secondary structure
prediction is less sensitive to alignment errors than accessibility
prediction.

Better + worse = even better? Today, several automatic services accomplish
secondary structure predictions. Some users fall into the
what-is-common-is-correct trap, i.e., they average over all prediction
methods and consider identical regions as more reliable. Exceptionally, such
a majority vote may be beneficial. However frequently, the result will be
the worst-of-all prediction. Often, it is preferable to use reliability
indices provided by some methods. Such indices answer the question: how
reliably is the tryptophan at position 307 predicted in a surface loop?
(Note: the correlation between such indices and prediction accuracy is
sufficiently tested for a few methods, only.)

1D structure may or may not be sufficient to infer 3D structure. Say you
obtain as prediction for regular secondary structure:
helix-strand-strand-helix-strand-strand (H-E-E-H-E-E). Assume, you find a
protein of known structure with the same motif (H-E-E-H-E-E). Can you
conclude that the two proteins have the same fold? Yes and no, your guess
may be correct, but there are various ways to realise the given motif by
completely different structures. For example, the secondary structure motif
'H-E-E-H-E-E' is contained in, at least, 16 structurally unrelated proteins.

Nuts and bolts: what to keep in mind?

Information content in multiple sequence alignment

If the multiple sequence alignment contains only a few proteins very similar
to the one you sent (pairwise sequence identity > 90%), the expected
accuracy for 1D structure predictions (secondary structure, accessibility,
transmembrane helices) drops significantly. Note: this implies a reduction
of the expected accuracy for threading. The scores for expected accuracy
(PHDsec, PHDacc., PHDhtm) are valid for typical alignments as to be found in
the HSSP database. The information content of the alignment is difficult to
measure. Two important parameters are:

   * (1) Number of aligned sequences: the more sequences in the alignment,
     the better. The exact number of sequences needed for a 'good
     prediction' cannot be given, as it depends on the variation and on
     characteristics of the particular protein family. As a rule of thumb:
     one is clearly NOT sufficient, more than five sequences can be enough.
   * (2) Variation of aligned sequences: the aligned sequences should have a
     considerable variation with respect to the guide sequence (your
     protein). Ideally, the alignment should contain sequences at levels of
     80%, 60%, 50%, 40%, and about 30% pairwise sequence identity (with
     respect to the predicted protein). In general, more diverged sequences
     (30-40%) contribute more to the information content than do very
     similar ones (> 80%). Note: the levels of sequence identity are
     summarised in the alignment header of the output returned (example).

NOTE HOWEVER:

   * (A) Alignment errors for distant homologues: More distantly related
     sequences contribute more to the alignment diversity which is the base
     for an improved prediction accuracy. However, the more distant relative
     are difficult to align (actually below levels of some 40% sequence
     identity some alignment errors are guaranteed). Furthermore, even the
     correct detection of more distant relatives is getting highly
     complicated below levels of about 35% sequence identity.
   * (B) Bias by identical sequences: Growing data bases result in an
     explosion of highly redundant information. This has recently (1996-7)
     led to the situation where the previous rule 'the more sequences, the
     better' is not applicable anymore. Instead, you should leave out some
     (or all) family members in the high homology (>70%) region, in
     particular, when there are not many rather diverged sequences present.
     Furthermore, the current version of PHD does not handle redundant
     information, i.e., when you have two proteins A and B of say 40%
     sequence identity to your query, and when A and B are highly similar
     (>90% sequence identity to one another), you should leave out one of
     the two from the alignment you use for the prediction!

Cut-off for including homologues in alignment

In the multiple sequence alignment returned to you, only homologues down to
levels of 30% pairwise sequence identity over 80 or more residues are
included. This cut-off is five percentage points above the threshold for
structural homology (Sander & Schneider, 1990), in an attempt to stay
clearly off the twilight zone of sequence similarity, and provide
high-quality multiple alignments in an automated fashion.

Quality of multiple sequence alignment

On average, more residues are falsely aligned for lower levels of pairwise
sequence identity. Down to levels of about 30%, the automatic MaxHom
alignments are usually quite accurate. However, for many families there are
regions for which the 'correct' alignment is, in principle, not well
defined. One way to spot such regions is the stability of the alignment with
respect to including or excluding some of the aligned sequences. By
providing different lists of sequences ("input option 'PIR list'") you can
monitor the stability of the alignment. Often such regions may form surface
loops. Predictions may be less accurate in such regions.

Minimal length of sequences

The PHD programs treat N- and C-terminal ends of proteins as solvent
molecules. The size of the input window for predicting 1D structure is up to
17 residues. Thus, the first and the last 17 residues of your sequence will
'see solvent'. Especially for short fragments you did cut out from large
proteins, this may result in false predictions.

Insertions in multiple sequence alignment

   * Insertions in guide sequence: Do NOT use insertions for the guide
     sequence when you supply your alignment to be used as input for the
     predictions ("input option 'MSF format'"). In the current
     implementation, PHD will treat such insertions as if the corresponding
     positions were occupied by solvent. This may lead to particular
     prediction errors ( example )!
   * Split alignment into domains: If your alignment (of say 20 sequences)
     contains long (> 10 residues) regions for which only very few sequences
     do not have insertions (in positions R1-R2), split the alignment into
     fragments that are not full of insertions for all sequences. For the
     problematic region (R1-R2) it may be better to include only those
     sequences without insertions. The existence of such regions may
     indicate that the protein contains various domains (one for residues <
     R1, another for residues > R2). When you submit your alignment in
     fragments, mind the minimal length of sequences (see above).

'Untypical' proteins

   * Globular, water-soluble proteins. The PHD neural networks have been
     trained on proteins with typical features as contained in the database
     of known protein structures (PDB). Thus, accuracy may be lower if the
     methods are applied to other proteins. For instance, PHDsec (secondary
     structure) correctly predicts only about 50% of the residues in
     transmembrane helices of integral membrane proteins. However, the
     network system trained on transmembrane proteins (PHDhtm) predicts
     residues in transmembrane helices on average at a level of well above
     90% accuracy. In general, the PHD methods learn to extract
     characteristics features of currently known protein structures.
     Problematic cases are proteins with many cysteine bridges that
     stabilise the particular protein structure, or proteins for which the
     structure is stabilised by functional constraints (co-factors).
   * Transmembrane proteins. PHDhtm for globular proteins. The rate of false
     positives, i.e., of globular, water-soluble proteins for which PHDhtm
     predicts transmembrane helices, is in the order of 5%. Such false
     positive predictions occur more often for structures with very
     hydrophobic beta-strands. Consequently, a prediction of transmembrane
     helices for a globular protein may indicate the existence of very
     hydrophobic beta-strands. PHD for porin-like beta structures. For the
     beta-strand transmembrane protein, porin, the accuracy of PHDsec was
     below the expected average (60%), but it was higher than the average
     for helical transmembrane proteins (50%). The explanation may be that
     the barrels formed by porins share features of globular, water-soluble
     proteins and thus can be predicted relatively well. MaxHom alignments
     for transmembrane proteins. The alignment procedure MaxHom is optimised
     on globular water-soluble proteins. For transmembrane proteins, the
     alignments of the more hydrophobic transmembrane segments may require
     changes in the alignment details. Furthermore, in particular in
     transmembrane regions, often more distantly related sequences could be
     aligned by hand based on, e.g., hydrophobicity analyses. Unfortunately,
     we do not yet provide such refinements of the alignment automatically.
   * Multi-domain proteins. The accuracy for predicting solvent
     accessibility (PHDacc) for single-domain proteins is higher than for
     multi-domain proteins. Predictions are more likely to be wrong at
     interfaces between domains. This shortcoming may be used to predict
     inter-domain interfaces in regions where PHDacc predicts buried
     residues that would otherwise not be compatible with your guess about
     the fold of the protein.
   * Novel folds are NOT 'untypical proteins'. The expected prediction
     accuracy for the PHD programs has been re-evaluated several times over
     the last years. So far, the results have always confirmed our estimates
     (Rost & Sander, 1995, Proteins, 1995, 23, 295-300).

Prediction of transmembrane helices (HTM's) and topology

   * False positives: globular proteins predicted with HTM's. By default we
     search for possible transmembrane helices in your sequence. The rate of
     false positive detection (i.e. proteins falsely predicted to contain
     transmembrane helices) is about 1.6%. Thus, a reported transmembrane
     segment may just indicate a rather hydrophobic patch in a globular
     protein. If you explicitly request a prediction of transmembrane
     helices (HTM's), we assume that you know the protein to contain HTM's
     and consequently apply a lower threshold to eliminate false positives.
   * Refined prediction of transmembrane helices and topology. By default we
     use the neural network system PHDhtm and an empirical filter to predict
     the locations of transmembrane helices. A refined (more accurate)
     version of that program, as well as, the prediction of transmembrane
     topology (orientation of N-terminal non-transmembrane region with
     respect to cell) is available upon request ("predict htm topology").
     All predicted HTM's are sorted according to the reliability of the
     prediction. This may help experts to spot HTM's predicted falsely based
     on a reliability index provided. Note: try NOT to provide sequences
     that start or end with HTM regions as this may result in wrong topology
     predictions!

Reliability indices for PHD predictions

The reliability indices of the PHD methods correlate well with prediction
accuracy. In other words, residues predicted with high reliability (0 = low,
9 = high) are more likely to be predicted correctly. However, when basing
the prediction on single sequences (rather than multiple alignments) the
scale has to be shifted. For instance, values of RI > 4 usually imply an
expected accuracy of > 80% for PHDsec. When using a single sequence as input
the same level of accuracy is reached only for residues predicted at RI > 7.

Combination of results with that of other methods

A combination of two prediction methods is likely to improve the accuracy
only if the following points are met:

   * (1) the predictions are based on methods using independent information,
     e.g., prediction-based threading and potential-based threading,
   * (2) the accuracy of the two methods is comparable, e.g., NOT for
     combining Chou-Fasman (about 50% accuracy) and PHDsec (> 72% accuracy),

Say you want to focus on the most likely secondary structure segments. You
may hope that the best predicted segments are those for which methods X and
PHDsec agree. This may or may not be correct. However, it may be more
reasonable to identify such regions based on the reliability index provided
by PHD. The PHD methods have been tailored to provide a reasonable estimate
for the reliability of the prediction, whereas a combination of two
arbitrary prediction methods, at best, yields improvements, at random.

Homologue of known structure

Ab-initio prediction (by e.g. PHD) is, in general, less accurate than is
homology modelling. Thus, if we find a protein of known structure that has >
25% pairwise sequence identity to your sequence, you ought to make use of
the known structure by homology modelling.

Prediction-based threading

   * Most alignments returned are wrong! We decided to return quite a number
     of alignment hits from the threading search. Most of those will be
     wrong. On the one hand, this is caused by a rather low accuracy of
     threading methods. On the other hand, successful threading requires
     experience in analysing protein sequences on the side of the user.
     Although most hits reported by the threading program (TOPITS alias
     TOPITS) will be wrong, you may arrive at some correct conclusions from
     the alignments. Just bear in mind: threading is likely to be more often
     wrong than correct.
   * Combining prediction-based and potential-based threading. The first
     problem of all threading programs is a high proportion of false
     positives, i.e., proteins falsely predicted to have a fold similar to
     the search sequence. One successful strategy to reduce the number of
     false positives is a combination of the results from prediction-based
     threading (such as TOPITS) with those from potential-based threading.

New prediction defaults

   1.04.99
     Low-complexity regions by SEG (default, example): The program SEG (J C Wootton & S Federhen) is executed, by default. SEG scans
     your sequence for regions of low-complexity ('simple sequences' or 'composition-biased regions'). You may turn this default off by using the
     keyword 'no seg in any line before the one beginning with a hash ('#'). 
   2.03.99
     Filtering your alignment (default): Your alignment will be filtered before running PHD, in order to reduce possible redundancy. You may
     turn this default off by using the keyword 'no filter. 

New output option

   1.04.98
     Return no seg ('return no seg') 
     The string "return no seg" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that SEG results are not returned. 
   2.04.99
     Store results here, return no mail output ('return no mail') 
     The string "return no mail" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that we shall not returned the results by mail. Instead,
     the results for your requests will be stored on our machines for 3 days, and you will receive a mail that simply tells you how you can ftp the
     result from here. The reason for including this option is that some requests may result in very large output files, and those may be difficult to
     handle for your local mailing device (in particular when you request HTML formatted output). 
   3.04.99
     Return output in HTML format ('return html') 
     The string "return html" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that the email you get will have the entire results attached
     in one HTML formatted file (which you can load into any WWW browser). 
     The conversion of the old format to the new one is still rather rudimentary. However, thanks to the program MView (Nigel Brown, MRC, Mill
     Hill, London) part of the output is already much easier to digest in this new format! 
   4.04.99
     Return output in HTML format for printouts ('perline=60') 
     The strings "return html60" OR "perline=N" (with N=1..number of residues of your protein) in any line before the one starting with a hash (#)
     result in that the email you get will have the all output attached in one HTML formatted file (to display with any WWW browser) that has fewer
     characters per line than the normal HTML output (see "return HTML"), so that you can print the output. (For further information see the
     option "return html".) 
   5.04.99
     Return output in HTML format (with PHD graphics) ('return html detail') 
     The string "return html detail" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that the email you get will have the entire results
     attached in one HTML formatted file (which you can load into any WWW browser), furthermore, the PHD predictions will also be displayed
     graphically. 
     Note: the HTML files resulting from the PHD predictions may be large. To avoid that your mail will be too big, you may therefore use the
     option of leaving the result on our machines, and simply ftp it to your local machine (see option "return no mail"). 
   6.04.99
     Return output (with PHD graphics) in HTML format for printouts ('perline=60') 
     The strings "return html detail 60" OR "perline=N" (with N=1..number of residues of your protein) in any line before the one starting with a
     hash (#) result in that the email you get will have the all output attached in one HTML formatted file (to display with any WWW browser) that
     has fewer characters per line than the normal HTML output (see "return HTML detail"), so that you can print the output. (For further
     information see the option "return html".) 
     Note: the HTML files resulting from the PHD predictions may be large. To avoid that your mail will be too big, you may therefore use the
     option of leaving the result on our machines, and simply ftp it to your local machine (see option "return no mail"). 

New input option

   1.03.99
     Your input sequence by its SWISSPROT identifier ('# swissid') 
     You can submit your sequence through its SWISS-PROT identifier. The string "# SWISSID" prompts the system to interpret the following
     line to be an identifier of the form 'name_species' (example for input). 
     NOTE: only identifiers in our current SWISS-PROT release are valid. 
   2.03.99
     Your input sequence(s) by FASTA alignment ('do not align') 
     You can submit your alignment in FASTA format. This requires two keywords: (1) the string "# FASTA list" prompts the system to interpret
     your alignment as one in the FASTA format (specification and example for FASTA list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line
     before the one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment will not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences via
     FASTA format). 
   3.03.99
     Your input sequence(s) by PIR alignment ('do not align') 
     You can submit your alignment in PIR format. This requires two keywords: (1) the string "# PIR list" prompts the system to interpret your
     alignment as one in the PIR format (specification and example for PIR list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line before the
     one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment will not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences via PIR
     format). 






PP news 1998

New input option 

   1.02.98
     Your input sequence(s) in FASTA-list format ('# FASTA list ') 
     You can submit your alignment in a format which is hopefully easier for you to write than the MSF format. The string "# FASTA list" prompts
     the system to interpret your alignment as one in the SAF format (specification and example for FASTA list format). 

New prediction defaults 

   1.04.98
     Coiled-coil regions: now by default the program COILS written by Andrei Lupas is run on your sequence. An output is returned if a
     coiled-coil region has been detected. 
   2.04.98
     Functional sequence motifs: now by default the PROSITE database written by Amos Bairoch, Philip Bucher and Kay Hofmann is scanned
     for sequence motifs. An output is returned if any motif has been detected. 

New output options 

   1.04.98
     Return also BLASTP output ('return blast') 
     The string "return blast" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) returns additionally the unfiltered BLASTP output. 
   2.04.98
     Return prediction additionally in RDB format ('return phd rdb') 
     The string "return phd rdb" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in RDB format (as read
     and written by local versions of the programs PHD and TOPITS). 
   3.04.98
     Return topits hssp ('return topits hssp') 
     The string "return topits hssp" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) returns the threading output additionally in HSSP format. 
   4.04.98
     Return no coils ('return no coils') 
     The string "return no coils" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that COILS results are not returned. 
   5.04.98
     Return no prosite ('return no prosite') 
     The string "return no prosite" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) results in that PROSITE results are not returned. 





PP news 1997

New input option 

   1.06.97
     Your input alignment in SAF format ('# SAF format ') 
     You can submit your alignment in a format which is hopefully easier for you to write than the MSF format. The string "# SAF" prompts the
     system to interpret your alignment as one in the SAF format (specification and example for SAF format). 

New output options 

   1.03.97
     Return prediction additionally in MSF format ('return phd msf') 
     The string "return phd msf" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in an MSF format
     (appended to the alignment). 
   2.03.97
     Return prediction additionally in CASP2 format ('return phd casp2') 
     The string "return phd casp2" in any line before the one starting with a hash (#) returns the PHD predictions additionally in the format used for
     the second protein structure prediction contest in Asilomar, 1996 (CASP2).

Notes 

   1.The error rate in falsely predicting transmembrane helices for globular proteins has been reduced by a new program to below 2%. 

New services 

   1.11.96: Estimate for approximate response time of PredictProtein 
   2.03.96: Refined prediction of transmembrane helices and topology (PhdTopology) 

Short description of new service 

     Refined prediction of transmembrane helices and topology (help on topology prediction; examples for: request; and output) 
     The neural network prediction of transmembrane helices (PHDhtm) is refined by a dynamic programming-like algorithm. This method
     resulted in correct predictions of all transmembrane helices for 89% of the 131 proteins used in a cross-validation test; more than 98% of the
     transmembrane helices were correctly predicted. The output of this method is used to predict topology, i.e., the orientation of the N-term with
     respect to the membrane. The expected accuracy of the topology prediction is > 86%. Prediction accuracy is higher than average for
     eukaryotic proteins and lower than average for prokaryotes. PhdTopology is more accurate than all other methods tested on identical data sets
     (Rost, Casadio & Fariselli, Protein Science, 1996). 

New defaults 

   1.03.96: For predicting the locations of transmembrane helices, PHDhtm is used. The more accurate refined version along with the prediction of
     topology (PHDtopology) is available upon request ('predict htm topology').

  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interested in the PP software?

   * PredictProtein is not easily portable, yet. To make it become a program
     that can easily by ported to any location (running UNIX or LINUX
     platforms) is on my list of things-to-do.
   * PHD codes are available, respectively will be in the near future.
   * All WWW pages are public. That is: no restrictions to downloading them
     (provided you keep the reference!).

Links to selected WWW services

To dig out 'putatively relevant sites' on the web is not a problem anymore.
The crucial part of searching on the web becomes to filter the pearls. We
(RS and BR) selected a list of WWW sites useful for molecular biology when
compiling a guide to sequence analysis (paper). We would be grateful if you
notice dead links to us!

  1. General sites
     search engines, literature, pathways, genomes
  2. Databases
     general, miscellaneous, DNA/RNA, protein sequences, protein structures
  3. Services
     hotlists, general, data base searches, analysing DNA/RNA, protein
     structure prediction
  4. Software
     general, documentation, alignments, homology modelling, threading

Restrictions (watch it!)

   * If there are only a few homologous protein sequences in the database
     that are not too similar to the one you sent (pairwise sequence
     identity > 90%), prediction accuracy drops for structure predictions
     (secondary structure, accessibility, transmembrane helices).
   * In the multiple sequence alignment returned to you, only homologues
     down to 30% identity over 80 or more residues are included. This cutoff
     is five percentage points above the threshold for structural homology
     (Sander & Schneider, 1991), in an attempt to stay clearly off the
     twilight zone of sequence similarity, and provide high-quality multiple
     alignments in an automated fashion.
   * The alignment procedure MaxHom is optimised on globular water-soluble
     proteins. For transmembrane proteins, the alignments of the more
     hydrophobic transmembrane segments may require changes in the
     alignments. Furthermore, in particular for transmembrane regions, often
     more distantly related sequences could be aligned by hand based on
     hydrophobicity analyses. Unfortunately, we cannot provide such
     refinements of the alignment automatically.
   * If you don't (explicitly request a prediction of transmembrane helices,
     possible HTM's may not be detected as a particular threshold is applied
     to avoid over-prediction.
   * Functional sequence motifs from ProSite are reported only if found.
   * Coiled-coil regions are predicted only if the signal for these detected
     by the COILS program exceeds a minimal threshold (of 0.5).
