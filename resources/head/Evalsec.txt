SYM          where N is the total number of residues, S1 and S2 are the ob-  
SYM          served and predicted secondary structure segments (in state i), 
SYM          and LEN(S1) is the number of residues in the segments of S1.    
SYM          The sum (SUMSUMSUM) is taken over all segment pairs S={S1,S2}.  
SYM          The actual overlap bewteen the two segments is MINOV, i.e.,the  
SYM          number of residues for which both segments have, e.g., a H (he- 
SYM          lix) in common; maxov is the total extent of both segments,i.e.,
SYM          the number of residues jfor which either jof the two has, say,  
SYM          the assigned state H.  The accepted variation DELTA assures a   
SYM          ratio of 1.0 when there are only minor deviations at segment    
SYM          ends; it is chosen to be smaller than MINOV and smaller than    
SYM          half the length of segment S1.  The ratio MINOV/MAXOV is con-   
SYM          strained to a maximum value of 1.0, i.e., the allowance cannot  
SYM          lead to a "more than perfect" value of fractional overlap for   
SYM  obs     any segment comparison.  The addition of 'obs' (SOV(i)obs)      
SYM          indicates that the length of the observed segments was used for 
SYM          weighting (likelihood that an observed segment is correctly     
SYM  prd     predicted), i.e., S1 is the observed segment. In contrast, 'prd'
SYM          labels the weighting by the lengtyh of the predicted segments   
SYM          (likelihood that a predicted segment is correct).
