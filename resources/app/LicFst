Dear user,

the prediction service is free only for the academic community.
The current procedure is that we permit some tests free of 
charge.  For your site, this limit of free predictions has been 
used.  Should you be interested in further prediction from the
PredictProtein server, please contact:
	Predict-help@columbia.edu
for signing a license.

With my best regards,

Burkhard Rost
