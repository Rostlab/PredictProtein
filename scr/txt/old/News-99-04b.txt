  Dear user,

    PredictProtein  has moved from EMBL (Heidelberg) to  CUBIC (New York),
  it is now running on 8 processors of an SGI Origin 2000:
  	dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu.

  web interface:             http://dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/
  email submission:          predictprotein@dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu
  email to administrator:    predict_help@dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu
  fax to administrator:      B Rost, (1)-212-305-7932
  
  Note:   the previous WWW links at EMBL and EBI will stay active to speed
  up access times for the half of the users from Europe  (separate mirrors
  have been introduced in Asia and Australia:
  Australia:		     http://molmod.angis.org.au//predictprotein/
  Singapore:		     http://embl.bic.nus.edu.sg/predictprotein/

  However, the actual data will - from now on - be juggled in New York....


    I gladly  acknowledge the support from  various 'sources' enabling the
  move to Columbia University:

  - David Hirsh  (Dep of Biochem & Mol Biophysics, Columbia) unearthed the
    start-up money required for buying a machine to run PP from University
    sources.
  - Julie Nash (Silicon Graphics)  successfully worked out the  conditions
    for a 'special deal' to purchase an Origin 2000 on which PP is running
    now.
  - Further support from Columbia University came from:
    Barry Honig and Katie Rosa (Biochem & Mol Biophys) contributed import-
    antly to the fact that PP is already running on a machine in New York.
    Volker Eyrich (Chemistry) and  Murad Nayal (Biochem & Mol Biophys) as-
    sisted in appropriately setting up the machine running PP.
  - The 2 Southern mirrors are maintained by: Betty Chenk (BIC,Singapore),
    and Shoba Ranganathan (Angis, Australia).  
  
    One problem that may  immediately  become apparent is the insufficient
  internet connection of Columbia University.   The major problem seems to
  be caused by Columbia's internet provider:  Applied Theory, respectively
  Sprint.  We are working on this problem.
  
    Finally,  please note that some default settings have changed,   and a
  few new options - in particular for advanced users - have been implemen-
  ted.

  New output option
  
    1. 04.99
       Store results here, return no mail output ('return no mail')
       The string "return no mail" in any line before the one starting with a
       hash (#) results in that we shall not returned the results by mail.
       Instead, the results for your requests will be stored on our machines
       for 3 days, and you will receive a mail that simply tells you how you
       can ftp the result from here. The reason for including this option is
       that some requests may result in very large output files, and those may
       be difficult to handle for your local mailing device (in particular
       when you request HTML formatted output).
    2. 04.99
       Return output in HTML format ('return html')
       The string "return html" in any line before the one starting with a
       hash (#) results in that the email you get will have the entire results
       attached in one HTML formatted file (which you can load into any WWW
       browser).
       The conversion of the old format to the new one is still rather
       rudimentary. However, thanks to the program MView (Nigel Brown, MRC,
       Mill Hill, London) part of the output is already much easier to digest
       in this new format!
    3. 04.99
       Return output in HTML format for printouts ('perline=60')
       The strings "return html60" OR "perline=N" (with N=1..number of
       residues of your protein) in any line before the one starting with a
       hash (#) result in that the email you get will have the all output
       attached in one HTML formatted file (to display with any WWW browser)
       that has fewer characters per line than the normal HTML output (see
       "return HTML"), so that you can print the output. (For further
       information see the option "return html".)
    4. 04.99
       Return output in HTML format (with PHD graphics) ('return html detail')
  
       The string "return html detail" in any line before the one starting
       with a hash (#) results in that the email you get will have the entire
       results attached in one HTML formatted file (which you can load into
       any WWW browser), furthermore, the PHD predictions will also be
       displayed graphically.
       Note: the HTML files resulting from the PHD predictions may be large.
       To avoid that your mail will be too big, you may therefore use the
       option of leaving the result on our machines, and simply ftp it to your
       local machine (see option "return no mail").
    5. 04.99
       Return output (with PHD graphics) in HTML format for printouts
       ('perline=60')
       The strings "return html detail 60" OR "perline=N" (with N=1..number of
       residues of your protein) in any line before the one starting with a
       hash (#) result in that the email you get will have the all output
       attached in one HTML formatted file (to display with any WWW browser)
       that has fewer characters per line than the normal HTML output (see
       "return HTML detail"), so that you can print the output. (For further
       information see the option "return html".)
       Note: the HTML files resulting from the PHD predictions may be large.
       To avoid that your mail will be too big, you may therefore use the
       option of leaving the result on our machines, and simply ftp it to your
       local machine (see option "return no mail").

  
  New input option
  
    1. 03.99
       Your input sequence by its SWISSPROT identifier ('# swissid')
       You can submit your sequence through its SWISS-PROT identifier. The
       string "# SWISSID" prompts the system to interpret the following line
       to be an identifier of the form 'name_species' (example for input).
       NOTE: only identifiers in our current SWISS-PROT release are valid.
    2. 03.99
       Your input sequence(s) by FASTA alignment ('do not align')
       You can submit your alignment in FASTA format. This requires two
       keywords: (1) the string "# FASTA list" prompts the system to interpret
       your alignment as one in the FASTA format (specification and example
       for FASTA list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line
       before the one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment
       will not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences
       via FASTA format).
    3. 03.99
       Your input sequence(s) by PIR alignment ('do not align')
       You can submit your alignment in PIR format. This requires two
       keywords: (1) the string "# PIR list" prompts the system to interpret
       your alignment as one in the PIR format (specification and example for
       PIR list format), and (2) the keyword "do NOT align" in a line before
       the one starting with a hash ('#'), assures that your alignment will
       not be re-aligned (as for the options of submitting your sequences via
       PIR format).
  
  New prediction defaults
  
    1. 03.99
       Filtering your alignment By default your alignment will be filtered
       before running PHD, in order to reduce possible redundancy. You may
       turn this default off by using the keyword 'no filter.
