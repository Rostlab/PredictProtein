Alignment and Prediction by PredictProtein
------------------------------------------

as described in:

Rost, B., Sander, C. & Schneider, R. (1994).  PHD - an automatic server for pro-
        tein secondary structure prediction. CABIOS, 10, 53-60.

        works to predict protein secondary structure. Proteins, 19, 55-72.

        ity in Protein Families. Proteins, in press.


You send your protein sequence by electronic mail (internet), we return the fol-
lowing analyses for that sequence:

*       alignment of your sequence against current Swissprot data bank  (program 
        MaxHom)
*       prediction of  secondary  structure by a system of neural networks using 
        the alignment as inut (program PHDsec)
*       prediction of  relative  solvent  accessibility by neural networks using 
        the alignment as input (program PHDacc)

At any time the  newest version of the system is used for prediction  (currently 
version 5-94).

Prices are:     
        for <=   50 predictions per year                        1.000 $ 
        for <=  250 predictions per year                        2.000 $.
        
The license is valid for a company, it expires after 12 months.

Conditions:  no redistribution in whole or in parts,  internal company use only; 
publications from output must be quoted.
