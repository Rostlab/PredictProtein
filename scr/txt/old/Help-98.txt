What is PredictProtein (PP)?

PP is an automatic service for protein database searches and the prediction
of aspects of protein structure. You send an amino acid sequence and PP
returns:

  1. a multiple sequence alignment (i.e. database search),
  2. PROSITE sequence motifs,
  3. and predictions of
       a. secondary structure,
       b. residue solvent accessibility,
       c. transmembrane helices,
       d. coiled-coil regions.

The following features are available upon request:

  1. fold recognition by prediction-based threading, PDB is searched for
     possible remote homologues (sequence identity 0-25%) to your sequence;
  2. evaluation of prediction accuracy, for a given predicted and observed
     secondary structure (for one or several proteins), per-residue and
     per-segment scores are compiled.

For all services, you can submit your sequence (or prediction) either by
interactively from World Wide Web.

How does PredictProtein work?

Generating an alignment. The following steps are performed.

   * (1) the sequence database (currently only SWISSPROT) is scanned for
     similar sequences (by BLASTP).
   * (2) a multiple sequence alignment is generated by a weighted dynamic
     programming method (by MaxHom).
   * (3) PROSITE motifs are retrieved from the PROSITE database.

Prediction of protein structure in 1D. The multiple alignment is used as
input for profile-based neural network predictions (PHD methods). The
following levels of prediction accuracy have been evaluated in
cross-validation experiments:

   * (1) secondary structure prediction (PHDsec, Rost & Sander, 1993 and
     1994): expected three-state (helix, strand, rest) overall accuracy >72%
     for water-soluble globular proteins.
   * (2) solvent accessibility prediction (PHDacc, Rost & Sander, 1994),
     expected correlation between observed and predicted relative
     accessibility > 0.5.
   * (3) transmembrane helix prediction (PHDhtm, Rost, Casadio, Fariselli &
     Sander, 1995): expected overall two-state accuracy (transmembrane,
     non-transmembrane) > 95%; refined prediction of transmembrane helices
     and topology (PHDtopology, Rost, Casadio &and; Fariselli 1996),
     expected likelihood of predicting all helices correctly about 89%,
     expected accuracy of topology prediction > 86%.

Fold recognition by prediction-based threading. Predictions of secondary
structure and accessibility are aligned against PDB to detect remote
homologues (prediction-based threading; Rost 1995a and 1995b). As for other
threading methods, results should be taken with caution.

   * The first hit of the prediction-based threading is on average in 30% of
     the cases correct.
   * Hits with z-scores above 3.0 are more reliable (accuracy > 60%).
   * For exceptional cases the resulting alignments suffice for building
     correct homology-based models.

Evaluation of prediction accuracy. If you opt for 'evaluate prediction
accuracy', we evaluate the accuracy of the secondary structure prediction
provided by you. The following per-residue and per-segment scores are
returned: overall three-state accuracy, single state accuracy, correlation
coefficients, information entropy, fractional segment overlap, and finally
the accuracy of predicting secondary structure content and structural class
(Rost et al., JMB, 1994, 235, 13-26, example for output).

Multiple sequence alignment (MaxHom)

The multiple sequence alignments is built up in essentially three steps
(MaxHom, Sander & Schneider, Proteins, 1991, 9, 56-68).

  1. The protein database (currently SWISS-PROT) is searched by a fast
     alignment program (currently BLASTP).
  2. In sweep 1, sequences are aligned consecutively to the search sequence
     by a standard dynamic programming method. After each sequence has been
     added a profile is compiled, and used to align the next sequence.
  3. In sweep 2, after all sequences with significant homology have been
     picked from the BLASTP output, the profile is recompiled, and the
     dynamic programming algorithm starts once again to align consecutively
     the sequences, this time using the conservation profile as derived
     after completion of sweep 1.

Functional sequence motifs (PROSITE)

The following description is from the ">original PROSITE site:
http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/prosite.html
PROSITE is a method of determining what is the function of uncharacterized 
proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences.  It consists of a data-
base of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles that help to
reliably identify to which known family of protein (if any) a new sequence
belongs.


Secondary structure (PHDsec)

Secondary structure is predicted by a system of neural networks rating at an
expected average accuracy > 72% for the three states helix, strand and loop
(Rost & Sander, PNAS, 1993 , 90, 7558-7562; Rost & Sander, JMB, 1993 , 232,
584-599; and Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994 , 19, 55-72; evaluation of
accuracy). Evaluated on the same data set, PHDsec is rated at ten percentage
points higher three-state accuracy than methods using only single sequence
information, and at more than six percentage points higher than, e.g., a
method using alignment information based on statistics (Levin, Pascarella,
Argos & Garnier, Prot. Engng., 6, 849-54, 1993).
PHDsec predictions have three main features:

  1. improved accuracy through evolutionary information from multiple
     sequence alignments
  2. improved beta-strand prediction through a balanced training procedure
  3. more accurate prediction of secondary structure segments by using a
     multi-level system

Solvent accessibility (PHDacc)

Solvent accessibility is predicted by a neural network method rating at a
correlation coefficient (correlation between experimentally observed and
predicted relative solvent accessibility) of 0.54 cross-validated on a set
of 238 globular proteins (Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994, 20, 216-226;
evaluation of accuracy). The output of the neural network codes for 10
states of relative accessibility. Expressed in units of the difference
between prediction by homology modelling (best method) and prediction at
random (worst method), PHDacc is some 26 percentage points superior to a
comparable neural network using three output states (buried, intermediate,
exposed) and using no information from multiple alignments.

Transmembrane helices (PHDhtm)

Transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins are predicted by a
system of neural networks. The shortcoming of the network system is that
often too long helices are predicted. These are cut by an empirical filter.
The final prediction (Rost et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4, 521-533;
evaluation of accuracy) has an expected per-residue accuracy of about 95%.
The number of false positives, i.e., transmembrane helices predicted in
globular proteins, is about 2% (Rost et al. 1996).
The neural network prediction of transmembrane helices (PHDhtm) is refined
by a dynamic programming-like algorithm. This method resulted in correct
predictions of all transmembrane helices for 89% of the 131 proteins used in
a cross-validation test; more than 98% of the transmembrane helices were
correctly predicted. The output of this method is used to predict topology,
i.e., the orientation of the N-term with respect to the membrane. The
expected accuracy of the topology prediction is > 86%. Prediction accuracy
is higher than average for eukaryotic proteins and lower than average for
prokaryotes. PHDtopology is more accurate than all other methods tested on
identical data sets (Rost, Casadio & Fariselli, 1996a and 1996b; evaluation
of accuracy).

Coiled-coil regions (COILS)

The following description is from the original COILS site:
http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/COILS_form.html
COILS is a program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel
two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score.  By comparing this
score to the distribution of scores in globular and coiled-coil proteins, 
the program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a 
coiled-coil conformation.

Fold recognition by prediction-based threading (TOPITS)

Remote homologues (0-25% sequence identity) are detected by a novel
prediction-based threading method (Rost 1995a and 1995b). The principle idea
is to detect similar motifs of secondary structure and accessibility between
a sequence of unknown structure and a known fold . For the recognition of
similarities between entire folds, the expected accuracy (first hit of
alignment list correct) is about 60% (Rost, ISMB95 Proceedings, 1995, AAAI
Press, 314-321). If the goal is to correctly detect even short homologous
fragments, still about 30% of the first hits are correct (compared to an
accuracy of 14% for simple sequence alignments: full paper). Hits with
z-scores above 3.0 are more reliable (accuracy > 60%). (Note: a threading
service based on similar principles is provided by Daniel Fischer
(http://www.mbi.ucla.edu/people/frsvr/frsvr.html).

PLEASE CITE (!!)

Comment: if you find the following list too long, please note that
PredictProtein combines a large number of independent tools. Where other
servers adopt the philosophy 'one mail/WWW interface per tool' (for a few
examples), PP attempts to provide one single interface to many tools. Many
of the tools are at the forefront of bio-informatics (academics may 'pay'
these services by quoting).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFAULT INPUT FORMAT

For email submission create a file with the following content:

   * Your name, institution and address (one or more lines)
   * Your email address (one line)
   * Any additional relevant information (one or more lines)
   * Commercial users: "password(my_password)"
   * A one-line description of the protein sequence submitted that must
     start with the symbol "#".
   * The amino acid sequence in one-letter-code (one or more lines of any
     length, letters or blanks only, no special symbols or numbers, NOTHING
     may follow your sequence).

PredictProtein insists that you adhere to this format. Your input file will
in general only be read by a computer program. Any additional messages to be
read by one of us in person should be sent

by fax via:     Predict-Help at +49-6221-387517,
by email via:   Predict-Help@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE,
or via WWW:     http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein/send_feedback.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL INPUT FORMATS

The following input options have been implemented:

   * Use your unaligned set of sequences ("# FASTA list")
     You can provide sequences that are not yet in the Swissprot database.
     The sequences will be aligned automatically by the program MaxHom; the
     prediction will be based on this alignment. You use the header as
     described before, with "# FAST list" instead of "# sequence name". Then
     you append all your sequences successively in the PIR format after this
     line.
   * Use your unaligned set of sequences ("# PIR list")
     You can provide sequences that are not yet in the Swissprot database.
     The sequences will be aligned automatically by the program MaxHom; the
     prediction will be based on this alignment. You use the header as
     described before, with "# PIR list" instead of "# sequence name". Then
     you append all your sequences successively in the PIR format after this
     line.
   * Use your alignment ("# SAF")
     You can provide your alignment input to the PHD predictions. To do so,
     you have to generate a file in SAF (simple alignment format). Then you
     append this file to the same header as described before, with "# SAF"
     instead of "# sequence name".
   * Use your alignment ("# MSF")
     You can provide your alignment input to the PHD predictions. To do so,
     you have to generate a file in MSF (multiple sequence format), e.g.,
     generated by the program PILEUP (GCG). Then you append this file to the
     same header as described before, with "# MSF" instead of "# sequence
     name".
   * Use your prediction of 1D structure for threading ("# COLUMN format")
     You can provide your prediction of secondary structure and relative
     accessibility. (Both predictions are required. If you don't have, e.g.,
     a prediction of accessibility, use PHDacc to generate it.) Your
     prediction will be used for threading. You use the header as described
     before, with "# COLUMN format" instead of "# sequence name". Then you
     append your prediction in the "COLUMN format" after this line.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREDICTION OPTIONS

The following prediction options have been implemented:

   * Predict only secondary structure ("predict secondary structure")
     The string "predict secondary structure" (or short: "pred sec") in any
     line before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a prediction
     of secondary structure, only.
   * Predict only solvent accessibility ("predict accessibility")
     The string "predict accessibility" (or short: "pred acc") in any line
     before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a prediction of
     solvent accessibility, only.
   * Predict only transmembrane helices ("predict transmembrane")
     The string "predict transmembrane" (or short: "pred htm") in any line
     before the one beginning with a hash (#) results in a refined
     prediction of transmembrane helices and topology.
   * Prediction-based threading ("prediction-based threading")
     The string "prediction-based threading" in any line before the one
     beginning with a hash (#) requests the prediction-based threading. If
     you do not provide "your prediction for the fold recognition, we return
     a multiple sequence alignment, a prediction of secondary structure and
     accessibility, and the threading alignment of your sequence and
     possible remote homologues of known structure.
   * Prediction of coiled coils (Default)
     Coiled-coil regions are reported by default, if found.
   * PROSITE sequence motifs (Default)
     PROSITE sequence motifs are reported by default, if found.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFAULT OUTPUT

Prediction of 1D structure

The output format is self-documenting (examples given for the major prion
protein precursor prio_human (all,phd only) and the known 3D structure of
HIV protease 1hhp). (1) The first part is by default in the 'MSF' format. It
contains a list of the reliable homologues found in the protein sequence
database (SWISSPROT) and the multiple sequence alignment. (2) The second
part contains information about the strengths and limitations of the
prediction method. Please read this carefully to avoid any
misunderstandings. (3) The predictions are near the end of the file. Given
are:

  1. prediction of secondary structure for all residues, with an expected
     average three-state accuracy of > 72%;
  2. prediction of secondary structure for reliably scored residues only,
     with an expected three-state accuracy for these residues of > 82%;
  3. prediction of solvent accessibility for all residues, with an expected
     average correlation to the experimentally observed values of 0.54;
  4. prediction of solvent accessibility for reliably scored residues only,
     with an expected correlation between experimental observation and
     prediction of 0.69;
  5. prediction of transmembrane helices and their topology (if any
     detected), with an expected prediction accuracy of about 95% in two
     states.

Note: for the prediction of transmembrane helices a conservative threshold
is chosen. Thus, your protein may not be reported to contain a HTM although
it may have one. If you opt explicitly for the refined prediction of
transmembrane helices and topology ("predict htm"), four predictions are
given (example for output)):

  1. neural network prediction (expected accuracy for HTM's about 78%);
  2. result of empirical filter (expected accuracy for HTM's about 97%);
  3. refined prediction (expected accuracy for HTM's about 99%);
  4. prediction of topology (expected accuracy about 86%).

Prediction-based threading (fold recognition)

The results of the search for remote homologues are given in three blocks.
(1) An MSF formatted (default) alignment between your sequence and possible
remote homologues. (2) A summary of some statistics such as alignment scores
for a cross-validation experiment and for your request. (3) An alignment
presenting the entire motifs of 1D structure for the alignment.

Evaluation of secondary structure prediction accuracy

The output consists of two parts: (1) per-residue and per-segment scores for
each protein in your input file, and (2) per-residue and per-segment scores
for all proteins in your input file (the latter includes scores for the
accuracy in predicting secondary structure content and secondary structural
class; example for output).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL OUTPUT

mutually not exclusive, i.e. you can add most of these additional keywords
at the same time):

   * Return also BLASTP output ("return blast")
     The string "return blast" in any line before the one starting with a

     rest) can be used as input for usual graphics software (if
     appropriately extracted), such as KaleidaGraph, Excel, Mathematica,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROTECTION OF SEQUENCE DATA

Your sequence data is deposited in files to which only the PP administrator
(BR) has read access. No one else inside or outside of EMBL can read your
data, except our system administrators who are held to the highest standards
of confidentiality. Occasionally, the PP administrator may look at the data
in order to assess the performance of the server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRICTIONS

   * If there are only a few homologous protein sequences in the database
     that are not too similar to the one you sent (pairwise sequence
     identity > 90%), prediction accuracy drops for structure predictions
     (secondary structure, accessibility, transmembrane helices).
   * In the multiple sequence alignment returned to you, only homologues
     down to 30% identity over 80 or more residues are included. This cutoff
     is five percentage points above the threshold for structural homology
     (Sander & Schneider, 1991), in an attempt to stay clearly off the
     twilight zone of sequence similarity, and provide high-quality multiple
     alignments in an automated fashion.
   * The alignment procedure MaxHom is optimised on globular water-soluble
     proteins. For transmembrane proteins, the alignments of the more
     hydrophobic transmembrane segments may require changes in the
     alignments. Furthermore, in particular for transmembrane regions, often
     more distantly related sequences could be aligned by hand based on
     hydrophobicity analyses. Unfortunately, we cannot provide such
     refinements of the alignment automatically.
   * If you don't (explicitly request a prediction of transmembrane helices,
     possible HTM's may not be detected as a particular threshold is applied
     to avoid over-prediction.
   * Functional sequence motifs from PROSITE are reported only if found.
   * Coiled-coil regions are predicted only if the signal for these detected
     by the COILS program exceeds a minimal threshold (of 0.5).
