  Dear user,

    PredictProtein  has moved from EMBL (Heidelberg) to  CUBIC (New York),
  it is now running on 8 processors of an SGI Origin 2000:
  	dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu.

  web interface:             http://dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/
  email submission:          predictprotein@dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu
  email to administrator:    predict_help@dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu
  fax to administrator:      B Rost, (1)-212-305-7932

  Note:   the previous WWW links at EMBL and EBI will stay active to speed
  up access times for the half of the users from Europe  (separate mirrors
  have been introduced in Asia and Australia:
  Australia:		     http://molmod.angis.org.au//predictprotein/
  Singapore:		     http://embl.bic.nus.edu.sg/predictprotein/

  However, the actual data will - from now on - be juggled in New York....

  
    I gladly  acknowledge the support from  various 'sources' enabling the
  move to Columbia University:

  - David Hirsh  (Dep of Biochem & Mol Biophysics, Columbia) unearthed the
    start-up money required for buying a machine to run PP from University
    sources.
  - Julie Nash (Silicon Graphics)  successfully worked out the  conditions
    for a 'special deal' to purchase an Origin 2000 on which PP is running
    now.
  - Further support from Columbia University came from:
    Barry Honig and Katie Rosa (Biochem & Mol Biophys) contributed import-
    antly to the fact that PP is already running on a machine in New York.
    Volker Eyrich (Chemistry) and  Murad Nayal (Biochem & Mol Biophys) as-
    sisted in appropriately setting up the machine running PP.
  - The 2 Southern mirrors are maintained by: Betty Chenk (BIC,Singapore),
    and Shoba Ranganathan (Angis, Australia).  
  
    One problem that may  immediately  become apparent is the insufficient
  internet connection of Columbia University.   The major problem seems to
  be caused by Columbia's internet provider:  Applied Theory, respectively
  Sprint.  We are working on this problem.
  
    Finally,  please note that some default settings have changed,   and a
  few new options - in particular for advanced users - have been implemen-
  ted.

  New interface
       Default submission form simplified
       Expert form extensively extended
       Advanced intermediate level for submissions added
       Organisation of help pages thouroughly changed

  New output option
       Return output in HTML format ('return html')
       Return HTML output with 'primitive graphics' ('return html detail')

  New input option
       Paste in a SWISS-PROT sequences  as input
       Your input sequence(s) by FASTA alignment ('do not align')
       Your input sequence(s) by PIR alignment ('do not align')
  
  New prediction defaults
       Filtering your alignment By default your alignment will be filtered
       before running PHD, in order to reduce possible redundancy. You may
       turn this default off by using the keyword 'no filter.
