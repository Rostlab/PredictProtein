Results from ConSequenceS (Consensus Sequence Searches - PSI-BLAST
profile against databases of consensus sequences). The databases were
derived from the non-redundant versions of PDB and SWISS-PROT).


If you find the results or databases useful please cite the following:
1) Consensus sequences improve PSI-BLAST through mimicking
profile-profile alignments. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35(7):2238-46.
2) Powerful fusion: PSI-BLAST and consensus sequences. Bioinformatics
2008 Aug4 [Epub ahead of print].


This file contains alignments of the query sequence with consensus sequences.
On the left side:  consensus sequences are translated back into raw
(real) sequences.
On the right side: consensus sequences are not translated.
NOTE! Only the sequences were translated, all scores, sequence
identities, etc. pertain to alignments of consensus sequences.
