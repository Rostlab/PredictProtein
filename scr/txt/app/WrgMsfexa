The following is a valid MSF file :

Compulsory features are :
----------------------------------------

1) KEYWORDS
   Keywords "MSF:", "Type:" , and "Check:" in a line that ends with
   two dots. After the dots the data is assumed to start, anything pre-
   ceding that line may be missing.  The following abbreviations are 
   used:
   
   MSF:         = alignment length (length of longest sequence)

   Type:        = P for protein sequences, 
                = N for nucleotide sequences
   >>>          not used by PHD

   Check:       gives a checksum made up of the ASCII values of the se-
                quence characters.  This value can be used to check 
                whether an alignment has been edited since it was created.
   >>>          PHD does not make use of the explicit values given for
                Check.  Unfortunately, the current format converter soft-
                ware produces errors, if no number is given.  Thus, invent
                any number you want and put it here.


2) ALIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
   After the dots, and preceding the alignment, there is the alignment 
   description part.  

   Sequence identifier 
   The sequence names (following the keyword "Name:") HAVE to be UNIQUE 
   (different names for any sequence pair).  No blank is accepted within 
   a sequence name.  E.g. 'Id seq a' will be interpreted as: identifier 
   = Id, and amino acid 1-4 = s, e, q, a.  The maximal number of charac-
   ters of 'Id_seq_0' is 13.

   "Len:", "Check:", and "Weight:" 
   The fields "Len:", "Check:", and "Weight:" are not used for running the
   program PHD.  However, the conversion software again requires that num-
   bers (of any value) are given.

   The essential double backslash: "//"
   The description part is closed by a line starting with '//'.


3) ALIGNMENT
   The rest of the file is interpreted as alignment.  Any line not starting 
   with a sequence identifier (as given in the header!) is ignored.  If a 
   line starts with a correct identifier, say Id_seq_n, EVERYTHING following 
   the first word of this line is appended to the sequence Id_seq_n.



General note:
----------------------------------------

MSF is the multiple sequence alignment format of the GCG sequence analysis
package.  If you have access to the GCG package, the generation of an MSF
format is straightforward.  If not, and if you ought to have difficulties
generating it according to the above given protocol, please contact:
