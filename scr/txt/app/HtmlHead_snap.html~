<li>

<u><a name="NS">Non-strict mode (NS)</a></u> - most of the residues are
flexible; hence, a residue on the surface that is predicted to be rigid
is likely to have a functional role. </li>
<li><u><a name="strict">Strict mode (S)<a></u> - about a third of the residues are
flexible, therefore, a stretch of residues that is predicted to be
flexible might be important for the protein function. </li>

<li><u><a name="reliability">Reliability index</a></u> - the output of the network was converted
to reliability index reflecting the strength of the prediction (values
0-9). High value indicates strong prediction. RI_s marks the
reliability index of the strict mode and RI_ns marks the reliability
index of the non-strict.
</li>
<li><u><a name="acc">Accessibility</a></u> - solvent accessibility prediction by PROFacc
- 'e' marks exposed and 'b' marks buried. A residue that is predicted
to be &ge;16% exposed to the surface is defined to be exposed.</li>
