========================================================================
(ii)   What is PredictProtein
========================================================================

PredictProtein is an automatic service for protein database searches and
the prediction of aspects of protein structure.   You send an amino acid
sequence and PredictProtein returns:

  1. a multiple sequence alignment (i.e. database search),
  2. ProSite sequence motifs (more info),
  3. ProDom domain assignments (more info),
  4. and predictions of
       1. secondary structure (more info),
       2. solvent accessibility (more info),
       3. globular regions ( more info),
       4. transmembrane helices (more info),
       5. coiled-coil regions ( more info).

The following features are available upon request:

  1. fold recognition by prediction-based threading:
     PDB is searched for possible remote homologues  (sequence identity
     0-25%) to your sequence,
  2. evaluation of prediction accuracy (more info):
     for a given predicted and observed secondary structure  (for one or
     several proteins), per-residue and per-segment scores are compiled.

For all services, you can submit your sequence (or prediction) either by
electronic mail, or interactively from World Wide Web.

(iv)  Conditions of License for the use of the PredictProtein Service 
========================================================================


AGREEMENT effective for 12 months after first usage, between THE DEPART-
MENT OF  BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS  OF  COLUMBIA  UNIVERSITY 
("Licensor") and the undersigning party ("Licensee").

WHEREAS,  Licensor  is the  provider  of the results of certain computer
software and Licensee desires to obtain those results.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. License and Title.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, Licensor
     hereby  grants a  non-exclusive  and non-transferable  license (the
     "License") to Licensee to use the protein sequence analysis service
     known as   PredictProtein ,  hereto (the "Service") for a specified
     number of requests issued within the  twelve months of the validity
     of this agreement.
  b. The license expires after twelve months, or after the agreed number
     of predictions has been returned to Licensee.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Delivery of the Service.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Licensor shall deliver to Licensee,  upon request, the results from
     PredictProtein by email.
  b. At any given time within the twelve  months this Agreement is valid
     Licensee will have access to the latest version of the Service.
  c. The license is valid for all users from one company, if the company
