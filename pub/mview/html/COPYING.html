Copyright (C) Nigel P. Brown, 1997-1998. All rights reserved.

This License applies to the computer program(s) and libraries known as
"MView". The "Program", below, refers to such program, and a "work based on
the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work of the
Program, such as a translation or a modification, but excepting Program
output. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Nigel
P. Brown (the "Licensor").

BY USING, MODIFYING AND/OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON
THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE, AND ALL ITS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR
WORKS BASED ON IT.  NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION
TO USE, MODIFY AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS.
THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE, MODIFY AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

(ii) License

Permission is granted to copy, modify, and distribute the source code,
executables, and Program output as long as this and other copyright notices
remain intact on all files.

Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program to any third
party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such
distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or
indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or
payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program
"without charge", or payment for some product or service the delivery of
which requires for the recipient to retrieve/download or otherwise obtain a
copy of the Program; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive
enumeration of prohibited activities).

As an exception to the above rule, putting this program on CD-ROMs
containing other free software is explicitly permitted even when a modest
distribution fee is charged for the CD, as long as this software is not a
primary selling argument for the CD, and as long as the Licensor is
informed of the intended release.

All derived versions of the Program must be made freely available under the
terms of this license. The Licensor must be given the right to use the
modified source code in future versions of the software without any
compensation and without being required to separately name the parties
whose modifications are being used.

Use of this Program must be acknowledged by citing this reference in any
published work:

search or multiple alignment viewer. Bioinformatics. 14(4):380-381.

(iii) Limitations

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY USE, MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
