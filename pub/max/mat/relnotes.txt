2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE RELEASE 37

2.1  Sequences and annotations

2'106 sequences  have been added since release 37, the sequence data of 400
existing entries  has been  updated and  the annotations  of 12'576 entries
have been revised.


2.2  What's happening with the model organisms

We have  selected a  number of  organisms that  are the  target  of  genome
sequencing and/or mapping projects and for which we intend to:

o  Be as  complete as possible.  All sequences  available at a given time
   should  be  immediately  included  in  SWISS-PROT.  This also includes
   sequence corrections and updates;
o  Provide a higher level of annotation;
o  Provide  cross-references  to  specialized  database(s) that  contain,
   among other  data,  some genetic information about the genes that code
   for these proteins;
o  Provide specific indices or documents.

Here is the current status of the model organisms in SWISS-PROT:

 Organism        Database            Index file       Number of
                 cross-referenced                     sequences

 --------------  ----------------    --------------   ---------

Collectively the  entries from the above model organisms represent 38.5% of
all SWISS-PROT entries.

We plan  to finish as quickly as possible the annotation of the Escherichia
coli,  Haemophilus   influenzae,   Methanococcus   jannaschii   and   yeast
(S.cerevisiae) sequence entries which are not yet part of SWISS-PROT.

Please also  see the  description of  the Human  Proteomics  Initiative  in
section 10 of these release notes.


2.3  First steps in the conversion of SWISS-PROT to mixed-case characters

We are gradually converting SWISS-PROT entries from all UPPER CASE to MiXeD
CaSe. The  line-types that  have been  converted between  release 37 and 38
are: DT  (DaTe), OS  (Organism Species),  OC (Organism  Classification), OG
(OrGanelle), RL  (Reference Location)  and KW  (KeyWord). The RT (Reference
Title) lines  were already  introduced in  mixed-case  at  release  37.  As
described in  section 3.1,  the process  of converting all of SWISS-PROT to
mixed case is continuing.


2.4  Small change  in the  format of  RL lines  for submissions  to the DNA
     databases

Along with  the conversion  of the  RL to mixed-case (see 2.3) we have also
made a  small change  to the  format of RL lines for submissions to the DNA
databases. What used to be:

RL   SUBMITTED (MMM-YEAR) TO EMBL/GENBANK/DDBJ DATA BANKS.

is now:

RL   Submitted (MMM-YEAR) to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases.

This change  was made  to follow  more closely  the format used by the EMBL
nucleotide sequence database.


2.5  Introduction of a new CC line-type topic: MISCELLANEOUS

We have introduced in this release a new 'topic' for the comments (CC) line
type: MISCELLANEOUS.  This topic  is used  for all  comments which  do  not
belong to  any other  already defined  topic. This means that starting with
the current release all comments are now assigned to a topic. Example, what
was previously:

CC   -!- BINDS TO BACITRACIN.

is now:

CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: BINDS TO BACITRACIN.


2.6  Cleaning up of the SIMILARITY comment line (CC) topic

We are  continuing a  major overhaul of the SIMILARITY topic. We would like
the majority  of the  information stored  in this  topic to  be  usable  by
computer  programs   (while  being   human-readable).  We   are   therefore
standardizing the  format of this topic using two different subformats. One
to describe to which family a protein belongs:

CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE <Name1> FAMILY [OF <Name2>].
CC        [<Name3> SUBFAMILY.]

Examples:

CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE 14-3-3 FAMILY.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE 6-PHOSPHOGLUCONATE DEHYDROGENASE
CC        FAMILY.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE AAA FAMILY OF ATPASES.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE IRON/ASCORBATE-DEPENDENT FAMILY OF
CC        OXIDOREDUCTASES.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE ANTP FAMILY OF HOMEOBOX PROTEINS.
CC        "DEFORMED" SUBFAMILY.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FAMILY.
CC        KINESIN SUBFAMILY.

And one to describe which domains are found in a given protein:

CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: CONTAINS n <Name> [DOMAIN|REPEAT][S].

Examples:

CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: CONTAINS 1 FHA DOMAIN.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: CONTAINS 45 EGF-LIKE DOMAINS.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: CONTAINS 2 SH3 DOMAINS.
CC   -!-  SIMILARITY: CONTAINS 2 SUSHI (SCR) REPEATS.

We have  already updated many entries in this and the previous releases and
plan to complete this change for the next release.


2.7  Changes concerning cross-references (DR line)

We have added cross-references from SWISS-PROT to the Zebrafish Information
Network (ZFIN)  database available  at http://zfish.uoregon.edu/ZFIN/ (see:
Westerfield M.,  Doerry E.,  Kirkpatrick A.E.  and Douglas S.A.; Meth. Cell
Biol. 60:339-355(1999)).  These cross-references  are  present  in  the  DR
lines:

Data bank identifier: ZFIN
Primary identifier  : The ZFIN identifiers for a given gene.
Secondary identifier: The gene designation
Example             : DR   ZFIN; ZDB-GENE-980526-290; hoxa1.

We have  started to  add cross-references  from SWISS-PROT  to the CarbBank
Complex        Carbohydrate         Structure        Database        (CCSD)
(http://128.192.9.29/carbbank/). These  cross-references are present in the
DR lines:

Data bank identifier: CARBBANK
Primary identifier  : The CarbBank identifier for a given carbohydrate
                      structure.
Secondary identifier: A dash (-).
Example             : DR   CARBBANK; CCSD:27494; -.

In this  release, we have also updated all the DR lines pointing to the MIM
and Pfam databases.


2.8  Switching from  pID to  protein_ID  in  cross-references  to  the  DNA
     sequence databases

The DNA  sequence  databases  (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ)  recently  changed  their
referencing system  for CDS (CoDing Sequence). They used to associate every
CDS in  the database  with what  was called  a pID. The pID was a string of
variable length  composed of  a letter  (D, E  or G)  followed by  a number
(example: E345673).  Whenever the  protein sequence  coded by  a CDS  would
change due  to a  sequence or annotation revision, a new pID was attributed
to that  CDS. This system made it difficult to track down changes. pID have
therefore been replaced by what is now called protein_ID' (protein sequence
IDentifier). The  protein_ID consists of a stable ID portion (8 characters:
3 letters  followed by  5 numbers)  plus a  version number  after a decimal
point (example:  AAA03208.1). The  version number  only  changes  when  the
protein sequence  coded by  the CDS  changes, while the stable part remains
unchanged.

In release  38, we have converted the cross-references to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ
to use  the protein_ID  instead of  the pID  as the secondary identifier in
these DR lines. Example, what was previously:

DR   EMBL; Z75208; E1165324; -.

is now:

DR   EMBL; Z75208; CAA99603.1; -.

For a  number of  technical reasons,  there are still 732 pID referenced in
release 38, they will gradually be replaced by the corresponding protein_ID
for release 39.


2.9  Introduction of a unique identifier in the VARIANT feature description
     of human sequence entries

We have  introduced in  release 38  a unique  identifier  for  all  VARIANT
feature keys  in human  sequence entries.  This change  is the  first  step
toward providing  a unique  identifier to  all SWISS-PROT  features.  Human
sequence variants  were chosen  as a  prototype for this improvement. It is
now possible  to directly  link specific  sequence variants to the relevant
entries in disease mutation databases as well as to provide these databases
with a method to implement reciprocal links.

The unique  identifier is  of the  form of /FTId=VAR_nnnnnn and is added as
the last  part of the description field of 'VARIANT' feature keys. Example,
what was previously:

FT   VARIANT       6      6       E -> V (IN S; SICKLE CELL ANEMIA).
FT   VARIANT      11     11       V -> D (IN WINDSOR; O2 AFFINITY UP;
FT                                UNSTABLE).

is now:

FT   VARIANT       6      6       E -> V (IN S; SICKLE CELL ANEMIA).
FT                                /FTId=VAR_002863.
FT   VARIANT      11     11       V -> D (IN WINDSOR; O2 AFFINITY UP;
FT                                UNSTABLE).
FT                                /FTId=VAR_002873.



3.  FORTHCOMING CHANGES

3.1  Continuation of the conversion of SWISS-PROT to mixed-case characters

We will continue to convert SWISS-PROT entries from all UPPER CASE to MiXeD
CaSe. In  release 39  we are  planning to convert the RA (Reference Author)
and RC  (Reference Comment)  line types.  We will  also  convert  the  gene
designations in  the DR  (Database cross-Reference) lines for MGD, EcoGene,
StyGene, SubtiList and DictyDb to mixed case.

Further lines will be converted in release 40.

Here is an example of what a SWISS-PROT entry will look like in release 39:

3.2  Extension of the accession number system

With the  creation of  the TrEMBL  database (see  section 6)  and the rapid
increase in  the amount  of sequence  data, we  are faced with a problem of
availability of  accession numbers.  Currently we  use a  system based on a
one-letter prefix  followed by  5 digits.  This system was also used by the
nucleotide sequence  databases which had originally reserved for SWISS-PROT
the prefix letters O, 'P' and 'Q'. The nucleotide databases, having run out
of space  (due mainly  to EST's),  have been  forced to  start using  a new
format based on a two-letter prefix followed by 6 digits.

We have now used up all possible numbers with O, 'P' and 'Q'. As we believe
that changing  the format  of the accession numbers to that used now by the
nucleotide database  would create  havoc on  the numerous software packages
using SWISS-PROT,  we have  decided to  keep a  system of accession numbers
based on a six-character code, but with the following format extension:

    1        2       3          4            5            6
    [O,P,Q]  [0-9]  [A-Z, 0-9]  [A-Z, 0-9]   [A-Z, 0-9]   [0-9]

What the above means is that we will keep a six-character code, but that in
positions 3,  4 and  5 of  this code any combination of letters and numbers
can be  present. This format allows a total of 14 million accession numbers
(up from 300'000 with the current system).

We only allow numbers in positions 2 and 6 so that the SWISS-PROT accession
numbers can  not be  mistaken with  gene names,  acronyms,  other  type  of
accession numbers or any type of words!

Examples: P0A3S2, Q2ASD4, O13YX2, P9B123


3.3  Introduction of a new FT key: SE_CYS

Selenocysteine is  the 21st natural amino acid. It is now known to occur in
several dozen  proteins. Its  mRNA codon  is UGA, which usually serves as a
stop codon,  but with  a specific  downstream sequence forming a loop and a
specific translational  elongation factor.  It is recognized as the site of
selenocysteine incorporation into proteins.

Very recently  the joint  nomenclature committee  of the  IUPAC/IUBMB  (see
http://     www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iupac/jcbn/)      officially     recommended
(http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/1999/item3.html) a three-letter
and a one-letter symbol for selenocysteine, namely Sec and U.

We recognize that introducing a new one-letter code in the sequence records
would disrupt  most, if  not all,  sequence analysis software. We therefore
decided to  change, in  SWISS-PROT, the rules used to annotate the presence
of selenocysteine  residues in  sequence entries  in the  manner  described
below.

Currently selenocysteines  are stored,  in the  sequence records, using the
one-letter symbol  C for  cysteine and  are indicated  in the feature table
(FT) by a line of the type:

FT   BINDING       x      x       SELENIUM.

The one-letter  code will  not be changed (for the reason explained above),
but we  will introduce  a specific  feature key  (SE_CYS) to  indicate  the
presence of  a selenocysteine  at a  given  sequence  position.  The  above
example will therefore be changed to:

FT   SE_CYS        x      x

We also  want to  remind users  that the keyword Selenocysteine is and will
continue to  be used to tag sequence entries that contain at least one such
residue.


3.4  Introduction of a new CC line-type topic: PHARMACEUTICAL

We will  introduce in  the next release a new 'topic' for the comments (CC)
line type:  PHARMACEUTICAL. This  topic will describe the use of a specific
protein as  a pharmaceutical drug. The information provided by such a topic
will include  the brand  name(s) under  which a  protein is  available, the
name(s) of  the compani(es)  that produce it as well as a short description
of the therapeutic usage of the protein.

Examples:

CC   -!- PHARMACEUTICAL: Available under the names Avonex (Biogen),
CC       Betaseron (Berlex) and Rebif (Serono). Used in the treatment
CC       of multiple sclerosis (MS). Betaseron is a slightly modified
CC       form of IFNB1 with two residue substitutions.

CC   -!- PHARMACEUTICAL: Available under the name Proleukin (Chiron).
CC       Used in patients with renal cell carcinoma or metastatic
CC       melanoma.

It should be noted that any entries containing such a comment field will
also be tagged with the keyword Pharmaceutical.


3.5  Multiple AC lines

Starting with  release 39,  there can  be more than one AC (ACcession) line
per SWISS-PROT entry. Strictly speaking this is not a format change and the
users manual  of SWISS-PROT  always indicated that there could be more than
one AC line per entry. Until recently, a single line was sufficient and the
majority of  entries contained  only a single accession number. But, in the
process of  providing an  optimally non-redundant  database we  are merging
information from  TrEMBL entries  into SWISS-PROT  entries. When we merge a
TrEMBL entry  to a  SWISS-PROT one,  we add  to that  SWISS-PROT entry  the
accession number(s)  of the  TrEMBL entry. The repetition of such a process
sometimes produces  an accession  number list  which can no longer fit in a
single AC  line. Therefore  there will  now be some entries with two, three
(as shown below) or more AC lines.

AC   P16070; P22511; Q04858; Q13419; Q13957; Q13958; Q13959; Q13960;
AC   Q13961; Q13967; Q13968; Q13980; Q15861; Q16064; Q16065; Q16066;
AC   Q16208; Q16522;


3.6  Change in the syntax of the SQ line

The SQ  (SeQuence header) line marks the beginning of the sequence data and
gives a  quick summary  of its  content. The  format  of  the  SQ  line  is
currently:

SQ   SEQUENCE  XXXX AA; XXXXXX MW;  XXXXXXXX CRC32;

The last information item in the SQ line is a 32-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy
Check) value  which is  computed  from  the  sequence.  As  the  number  of
available sequences  is increasing rapidly, there are now a few cases where
two sequences can share the same CRC32 (but none, which also share the same
molecular weight  MW or number of amino acids AA). To address this issue we
will, starting with the next release, replace the 32-bit CRC value by a 64-
bit CRC. The format of the SQ line will therefore be changed to:

SQ   SEQUENCE  XXXX AA; XXXXXX MW;  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CRC64;

Example:

SQ   SEQUENCE   233 AA;  25630 MW;  146A1B48A1475C86 CRC64;

5.  THE EXPASY WORLD-WIDE WEB SERVER

5.1  Background information

The most  efficient and user-friendly way to browse interactively in SWISS-
PROT, PROSITE,  ENZYME, SWISS-2DPAGE  and other  databases is  to  use  the
World-Wide Web (WWW) molecular biology server ExPASy. The ExPASy server was
made available  to the  public in  September 1993  and is  reachable at the
following address:

                           http://www.expasy.ch/

The ExPASy  WWW server  allows access,  using the  user-friendly  hypertext
model, to  the SWISS-PROT, PROSITE, ENZYME, SWISS-2DPAGE, SWISS-3DIMAGE and
CD40Lbase databases. And, through any SWISS-PROT protein sequence entry, to
other databases  such as  EMBL, Eco2DBASE, EcoCyc, EcoGene, FlyBase, GCRDb,
MaizeDB,  Mendel,   OMIM,   PDB,   HSSP,   Pfam,   ProDom,   REBASE,   SGD,
SubtiList/NRSub, TRANSFAC,  YPD, ZFIN  and Medline. ExPASy also offers many
tools for the analysis of protein sequences and 2D gels.


5.2  Swiss-Shop

We    provide,     on    ExPASy,     a    service     called     Swiss-Shop
(http://www.expasy.ch/swiss-shop/). Swiss-Shop  is  an  automated  sequence
alerting system  which allows  users to  obtain,  by  email,  new  sequence
entries relevant  to their  field(s) of  interest. Various  criteria can be
combined:

-  By  entering  one  or  more  words  that  should  be  present  in  the
   description line;
-  By entering one or more species name(s) or taxonomic division(s);
-  By entering one or more keywords;
-  By entering one or more author names;
-  By entering  the accession number (or entry name) of a PROSITE pattern
   or a user-defined sequence pattern;
-  By entering the accession number (or entry name) of an existing SWISS-
   PROT entry or by entering a private sequence.

Every week,  the new  sequences entered  in  SWISS-PROT  are  automatically
compared with  all the  criteria that  have been defined by the users. If a
sequence corresponds  to the  selection criteria  defined by  a user,  that
sequence is sent by electronic mail.


5.3  What is new on ExPASy

ExPASy is  constantly modified  and improved. If you wish to be informed on
the changes made to the server you can either:

-  Read the  document History  of changes,  improvements and new features
   which is available at the address: http://www.expasy.ch/history.html
-  Subscribe to  Swiss-Flash, a  service that  reports news of databases,
   software and service developments. By subscribing to this service, you
   will automatically  get Swiss-Flash  bulletins by  electronic mail. To
   subscribe use the address: http://www.expasy.ch/ swiss-flash/

Among all  the improvements and the new features introduced during the last
three months,  here are  those that  we believe  are specifically useful to
SWISS-PROT users:

1. We have switched our default  view of  SWISS-PROT entry to that provided
   by the  NiceProt tool. NiceProt offers  a user-friendly  tabular view of
   SWISS-PROT  entries.  Access  to   the  original  SWISS-PROT  format  is
   maintained and  is directly available from the NiceProt view. Tools with
   similar functionalities have been  developed to  display the  ENZYME and
   PROSITE databases (see section 8.1 and 8.2).
2. We have  revised  the  ExPASy file  and directory structure, in order to
   have the  vast amount  of data  that has accumulated on the server since
   September 1993  available in a more structured manner, and to facilitate
   replication on our mirror sites. This has caused certain changes in html
   links, and you should update your bookmarks and links accordingly. If in
   doubt, please refer to the document 'How to create html links to ExPASy'
   (http://www.expasy.ch/expasy_urls.html). At the same  time  we  wish  to
   reiterate our  announcement of the  ExPASy  mirror  sites  in  Australia
   (http://expasy.proteome.org.au/) and Taiwan (http://expasy.nhri.org.tw/).
   For your own convenience,  please use  the mirror  site closest  to you.
   Please also make sure  to update all bookmarks or links that use the old
   domain expasy.hcuge.ch,  which was replaced by  www.expasy.ch  in  March
   1997! The 'expasy.hcuge.ch' address might be disabled in the near future.
3. WWW  links  have  been  implemented  between  SWISS-PROT  and  CarbBank,
   EcoGene and ZFIN.



6.  TREMBL - A SUPPLEMENT TO SWISS-PROT

The ongoing  genome  sequencing  and  mapping  projects  have  dramatically
increased the  number of  protein sequences  to be incorporated into SWISS-
PROT. Since we do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by
incorporating sequences  into the database without proper sequence analysis
and annotation,  we cannot  speed up the incorporation of new incoming data
indefinitely. But  as we  also want to make the sequences available as fast
as possible,  we have  introduced  with  SWISS-PROT  a  computer  annotated
supplement. This  supplement consists  of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format
derived from  the translation  of all  coding sequences  (CDS) in  the EMBL
nucleotide sequence database, except those already included in SWISS-PROT.

This supplement  is  named  TrEMBL  (Translation  from  EMBL).  It  can  be
considered as  a preliminary section of SWISS-PROT. This SWISS-PROT release
is supplemented by TrEMBL release 11. TrEMBL is split in two main sections;
SP-TrEMBL and REM-TrEMBL:

SP-TrEMBL (SWISS-PROT  TrEMBL) contains the entries (199'794 in release 11)
which should  be incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers
have been assigned for all SP-TrEMBL entries.

REM-TrEMBL (REMaining  TrEMBL) contains  the entries (45'967 in release 11)
that we  do not  want to  include in  SWISS-PROT for  a variety  of reasons
(synthetic sequences,  pseudogenes, translations  of incorrect open reading
frames,  fragments   with  less  than  eight  amino  acids,  patent-derived
sequences, immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors, etc.)

TrEMBL is available by FTP from the EBI and ExPASy servers in the directory
databases/trembl'. It  can be  queried on  WWW by  the EBI  and ExPASy  SRS
servers. It  is also  searchable on  the FASTA, BIC_SW and BLAST servers of
the EBI.



7.  FTP ACCESS TO SWISS-PROT AND TREMBL

7.1  Generalities

SWISS-PROT is  available  for  download  on  the  following  anonymous  FTP
servers:

Organization   Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)
Address        ftp.expasy.ch
Directory      /databases/swiss-prot/

Organization   European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
Address        ftp.ebi.ac.uk
Directory      /pub/databases/swissprot/


7.2  Weekly updates of SWISS-PROT

Weekly updates  of SWISS-PROT  are available  by anonymous FTP. Three files
are generated at each update:

new_seq.dat    Contains all the new entries since the last full release;
upd_seq.dat    Contains the  entries for  which the  sequence data has been
               updated since the last release;
upd_ann.dat    Contains the entries for which one or more annotation fields
               have been updated since the last release.

Important notes

o Although we try to follow a regular schedule, we do not promise to update
  these files  every week.  In most  cases two weeks may elapse between two
  updates.
o Instead of  using the  above files,  you can,  every  week,  download  an
  updated copy  of the  SWISS-PROT database.  This file is available in the
  directory containing the non-redundant database (see next section).


7.3  Non-redundant database

More than  a year  ago, we  started to distribute on the ExPASy and EBI FTP
servers, files  that make  up a  non-redundant (see  further) and  complete
protein sequence database consisting of three components:

1) SWISS-PROT
2) TrEMBL
3) New  entries to  be later  integrated into  TrEMBL (hereafter  known  as
TrEMBL_New)

Every week  three files  are completely  rebuilt. These  files  are  named:
sprot.dat.Z, trembl.dat.Z  and trembl_new.dat.Z.  As indicated  by their .Z
extension these  are Unix  compress format  files which, when decompressed,
will produce ASCII files in SWISS-PROT format.

Three  other  files  are  also  available  (sprot.fas.Z,  trembl.fas.Z  and
trembl_new.fas.Z) which  are compressed  fasta format sequence files useful
for building  the  databases  used  by  FASTA,  BLAST  and  other  sequence
similarity search  programs. Please  do not  use these  files for any other
purpose, as  you will  lose all  annotations by  using this  very primitive
format.

The files  for the  non-redundant database  are  stored  in  the  directory
/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on  the ExPASy  FTP server (ftp.expasy.ch) and in the
directory /pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on the EBI FTP server (ftp.ebi.ac.uk).

Additional notes

o The SWISS-PROT  file continuously  grows as  new annotated  sequences are
  added.

o The TrEMBL  file decreases  in size  as sequences  are moved  out of that
  section after  being annotated  and moved  into SWISS-PROT.  Four times a
  year a  new release  of TrEMBL  is built at EBI, at this point the TrEMBL
  file increases  in size as it then includes all of the new data (see next
  section) that has accumulated since the last release.

o The TrEMBL_New file starts as a very small file and grows in size until a
  new release of TrEMBL is available.

o SWISS-PROT and  TrEMBL  share  the  same  system  of  accession  numbers.
  Therefore you  will not  find any  primary  accession  number  duplicated
  between the  two sections.  A TrEMBL  entry (and its associated accession
  number(s)) can  either move  to SWISS-PROT as new entry or be merged with
  an existing SWISS-PROT entry. In the latter case, the accession number(s)
  of that TrEMBL entry are added to that of the SWISS-PROT entry.

o TrEMBL_New does not have real accession numbers. However it was necessary
  to have  an AC  line so  as to  be able to use it with different software
  products. This  AC line contains a temporary identifier which consists of
  the protein_ID  (protein sequence  identifier) of  the coding sequence in
  the parent nucleotide sequence.

o TrEMBL_New is  quite messy!  You will of course find new sequence entries
  but you will also encounter sequences that are going to be used to update
  existing TrEMBL  or SWISS-PROT entries. None of the "cleaning" steps that
  are applied to produce a TrEMBL release are run on TrEMBL_New nor are any
  of the  computer-annotation software  tools that  are used to enhance the
  information content  of TrEMBL. TrEMBL_New is provided only so that users
  can be  sure not  to miss  any important  new  sequences  when  they  run
  similarity searches.

o While these  three files  allow you to build what we call a non-redundant
  database, it  must be noted that this is not completely a true statement.
  Without going  into a  long explanation we can say that this is currently
  the best  attempt in  providing a  complete selection of protein sequence
  entries while  trying  to  eliminate  redundancies.  Also  SWISS-PROT  is
  completely (well  99.994% !) non-redundant, TrEMBL is far from being non-
  redundant and the addition of SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL is even less.

o To describe  to your users the version of the non-redundant database that
  you are providing them with, you should use a statement of the form:

     SWISS-PROT release 38 and updates until <current_date>;
     TrEMBL  release  11  minus  data  integrated  into  SWISS-PROT  as  of
     <current_date>;
     New preliminary TrEMBL entries created since release 11 of TrEMBL



8.  ENZYME AND PROSITE

8.1  The ENZYME nomenclature database

Release 25.0  of the  ENZYME  nomenclature  database  is  distributed  with
release 38 of SWISS-PROT. ENZYME release 25.0 contains information relative
to 3704  enzymes. In  this release,  we have  added a significant number of
synonyms (AN lines) to a number of entries.

The WWW  version of  ENZYME on  ExPASy now  provides a  more  user-friendly
tabular view of enzyme entries through a new tool called NiceZyme. NiceZyme
also provides  direct links,  through  Medline,  to  literature  references
relevant to  a specific enzyme. You can use this tool to link to any ENZYME
entry  by  using  the  following  type  of  URL:  http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-
bin/nicezyme.pl?a.b.c.d (where  a.b.c.d is  any  valid  enzyme  EC  number;
example: 1.2.1.1).

Please also  note that  the URL  of the  top page  of ENZYME  has moved to:
http://www.expasy.ch/enzyme/


8.2  The PROSITE database

Release 16.0  of the  PROSITE database  is distributed  with release  38 of
SWISS-PROT. This  release of  PROSITE contains  1034 documentation  entries
that describe  1'374 different patterns, rules and profiles/matrices. Since
release 15.0, 20 entries have been added and 180 entries have been updated.

The WWW  version of  PROSITE on  ExPASy now  provides a  more user-friendly
tabular view  of enzyme entries through a new tool called NiceSite. You can
use this  tool to link to any PROSITE entry by using the following types of
URL: http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/nicesite.pl?PSxxxxx (where PSxxxxx is any
valid  PROSITE  pattern  or  matrix  entry)  and  http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-
bin/nicedoc.pl?PDOCxxxxx (where  PDOCxxxxx is  any valid  PROSITE  document
entry).

Please also  note that  the URL  of the  top page  of PROSITE has moved to:
http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/



9.  WE NEED YOUR HELP!

We welcome feedback from our users. We would especially appreciate that you
notify us  if you  find that sequences belonging to your field of expertise
are missing  from the  database. We  also would  like to  be notified about
annotations to  be updated,  if, for example, the function of a protein has
been clarified or if new information about post-translational modifications
has become  available. To  facilitate this feedback we offer, on the ExPASy
WWW server, a form that allows the submission of updates and/or corrections
to SWISS-PROT:

              http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/sp_update_form.html

It is  also possible,  from any entry in SWISS-PROT displayed by the ExPASy
server, to  submit updates  and/or corrections  for that  particular entry.
Finally, you can also send your comments by electronic mail to the address:

                           swiss-prot@expasy.ch

Note that  since January  1999, all  update requests  are assigned a unique
identifier of  the form  UR-Xnnnn (example:  UR-A0123). This  identifier is
used internally  by the  SWISS-PROT staff  at SIB and EBI to track down the
fate of  requests and  is also  be used in email exchanges with the persons
having submitted a request.



10.  JULY 1999 ANNOUNCEMENT: THE HUMAN PROTEOMICS INITIATIVE

In a  few months the combined efforts of a number of sequencing centers and
companies will  produce a first draft of the human genome sequence. Such an
endeavor is  only a  very preliminary  step in  the understanding  of human
biological processes. The first pitfall to overcome is the detection of all
coding regions  on the  genomic sequence.  Current algorithms,  while being
very powerful,  are not  capable of detecting with certainty all exons, are
not well  equipped to  distinguish different splice variants and are unable
to detect small proteins (which are numerous and crucial to many biological
processes). Even when all potential coding regions have been predicted, the
user community  will have  at its disposition the sequence of from 80000 to
100000 naked  proteins.  We  call  these  proteins  naked  because  genomic
information does  not allow  the efficient  prediction  of  all  the  post-
translational modifications (PTM) of which the majority of proteins are the
target. Proteins,  once synthesized  on the  ribosomes, are  subject  to  a
multitude  of   modification  steps.   The  complexity  due  to  all  these
modifications is compounded by the high level of diversity that alternative
splicing can produce at the level of sequence. Thus the number of different
protein molecules  expressed by  the human  genome is  probably closer to a
million than  to  the  hundred  thousand  generally  considered  by  genome
scientists. Another factor of complexity to take into account is the amount
of polymorphism  at  the  protein  sequence  level.  While  some  of  these
polymorphisms are  linked to disease states, most are not, yet have in many
cases a direct or indirect effect on the activities of the proteins.

We therefore  are initiating  a major  project to  annotate all known human
sequences according  to the  quality standards  of SWISS-PROT.  This  means
providing, for  each known  protein, a  wealth of information that includes
the  description   of  its  function,  its  domain  structure,  subcellular
location, post-translational modifications, variants, similarities to other
proteins, etc.  There are currently slightly more than 5400 annotated human
sequences in  SWISS-PROT. These  entries are  associated with  about  14500
literature references;  16000 experimental  or predicted  PTMs, 800  splice
variants and  8000 polymorphisms  (most of  which are  linked with  disease
states). We  will use  the current information as the ground basis for what
we call the Human Proteomics Initiative (HPI).

The HPI  project contains  a number  of sub-components,  which are  briefly
described below:

ú Annotation of  all known  human proteins.  In the course of the next nine
  months (from  July 1999 to end of March 2000) the human protein sequences
  that are  not yet  in SWISS-PROT  will be  fully annotated.  We will also
  review and  complete the  annotation of  the human sequences currently in
  SWISS-PROT. At the end of this nine-month period we expect to be complete
  and up-to-date  and to  hereafter keep up with the appearance of new data
  relevant to human proteins.
ú Annotation of  mammalian orthologs  of human  proteins. We will make sure
  that for  any human  proteins,  existing  orthologs  in  other  mammalian
  species will  also be  annotated at  a level  equivalent to  that of  the
  cognate human sequences.
ú Annotation of  all known  human polymorphisms  at  the  protein  sequence
  level. As  mentioned above,  SWISS-PROT already  holds information  on  a
  sizeable amount  of such  polymorphisms, and it will significantly expand
  its effort  to store  and annotate  all small  variations at  the protein
  level.
ú Annotation  of   all  known  post-translational  modifications  in  human
  proteins. During  the next  nine months  a major  effort will  be made to
  supplement the  already quite  comprehensive description  of known  post-
  translational modifications  in  human  proteins  currently  provided  in
  SWISS-PROT.
ú Tight links  to structural  information. SWISS-PROT  is tightly linked to
  the PDB/RCSB  3D-structure database  and already  includes many  features
  useful to  structural biologists.  These  tight  links  will  be  further
  expanded by  providing homology-derived models for all human proteins for
  which such an approach is scientifically relevant.

For all  aspects of  the HPI  projects, we  would appreciate  the help  and
collaboration of the scientific community. Information concerning the human
proteome is  highly critical  to  a  large  section  of  the  life  science
community. We  therefore appeal  to the user community to fully participate
in this  initiative by  providing all the necessary information to help and
to speed up the comprehensive annotation of the human proteome.

The HPI  project has  two different time-related aspects: one of which is a
nine-month "marathon"  to catch  up with the current state of research, the
other one is a long-term commitment to keep such a project alive as long as
it is  necessary. For  a detailed  description of  the HPI  project and its
current status please consult:

11. JULY 1998 ANNOUNCEMENT: NEW SWISS-PROT FUNDING SCHEME

It became  obvious in  the last  years that the tremendous increase in data
flow has  created a  requirement for resources which cannot be addressed in
full by  public funding.  This is  causing databases  to  fall  behind  the
research. We believe that the only solution to the resource shortfall is to
ask commercial  users to  participate by paying a license fee. No fee is or
will be  charged to  academic users,  nor is  any restriction be imposed on
their use  or reuse  of the data. Both SWISS-PROT and PROSITE are concerned
by these changes, while this is not the case of ENZYME.

A document  fully describing  what will  be the  impact of  this change for
SWISS-PROT is  available with  the SWISS-PROT  distribution  files  on  FTP
(sp_info.txt). You  can also  access the document as well as other relevant
ones from:

                      http://www.expasy.ch/announce/
 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Information/Announcement/announcement.html

If you do not have the time to read this document, the most important take-
home message is that these changes do not have any impact on the way SWISS-
PROT or  PROSITE are  accessed or  redistributed. Academic  users  are  not
affected by  these changes.  Industrial end-users  are  also  not  directly
affected as  long as  their employer  pays the  license fee. The same holds
true for bioinformatics companies. Academic software or database developers
as well  as providers  of database distribution services are only minimally
affected by  these changes. We hope to be able to keep the spirit of SWISS-
PROT and  PROSITE alive  and  at  the  same  time  ensure  their  long-term
financial survival.  We sincerely  hope and  believe that  in the  next two
years the  only change  that will  matter will be the increase in scope and
timeliness of the databases.
