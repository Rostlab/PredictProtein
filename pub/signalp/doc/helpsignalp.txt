DESCRIPTION:

The SignalP mail server predicts the presence and location of signal
peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from different organisms:
Gram-positive prokaryotes, Gram-negative prokaryotes, and eukaryotes.
The method incorporates a prediction of cleavage sites and a signal
peptide/non-signal peptide prediction based on a combination of several
artificial neural networks.     


PAPER:

The method is described in 
"Identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptides and
prediction of their cleavage sites"

INSTRUCTIONS for using the SignalP mail server:

1)  Prepare a text file including one or more sequences. 
    The sequences should be in `FASTA' format: Each sequence must be
    preceded by a sequence header line starting by the symbol `>'
    immediately followed by a name (identifier) of the sequence.  The
    rest of the header line is ignored.  The sequences must be written
    using the one letter abbreviations  for the amino acids:
    `acdefghiklmnpqrstvwy' or `ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'.  Other letters
    will be converted to `X' and treated as unknown amino acids.  Other
    characters, such as blanks and numbers, will simply be ignored.

    It is recommended that the N-terminal part only (not more than 50-70
    amino acids) of the sequences is submitted.  A longer sequence will
    increase the risk of false positives and make the graphical output
    difficult to read.  

2)  Before the first sequence, the following keywords may appear:
    
    `euk', `gram-', or `gram+':
        Use networks trained on sequences from eukaryotes, Gram-negative
	prokaryotes, or Gram-positive prokaryotes, respectively.  If
	none of these keywords are found, predictions from all three
	network ensembles will be returned.  

    `postscript' or `graphics'
        Request a graphical output (in Postscript format) of the
	prediction.  The Postscript file will be sent as a separate
	message.  Before viewing the Postscript output, the mail headers
	must be removed.

    `help'
        Send this help file.  No other output will be returned.

3)  A line consisting of only a `.' (dot) terminates the sequences, and
    the rest of the message is discarded.  This is useful if your mailer
    automatically appends a signature.

4)  Mail the text file to signalp@cbs.dtu.dk.

5)  You will receive a mail containing the prediction, or possibly error
    messages, from the server.  Response time depends on system load.


EXAMPLE:

If you want a prediction of signal peptides in two human protein
sequences, and a graphical representation of the results, your
mail might look like this:

	euk
	graphics
	>10KS_HUMAN
	MKLAVTLTLV TLALCCSSAS AEICPSFQRV IETLLMDTPS SYEAAMELFS
	>1B05_HUMAN
	MRVTAPRTLL LLLWGAVALT ETWAGSHSMR YFYTAMSRPG RGEPRFITVG
	.


OUTPUT:

The SignalP  mail server will return three scores between 0 and 1 for
each position in your sequences:

C-score (raw cleavage site score):
	The output score from networks trained to recognize cleavage
	sites vs. other sequence positions.  Trained to be high at
	position +1 (immediately after the cleavage site) low at all
	other positions.  

S-score (signal peptide score)
	The output score from networks trained to recognize signal
	peptide vs. non-signal-peptide positions.  Trained to be high
	at all positions before the cleavage site low at 30 positions
	after the cleavage site and in the N-terminals of non-secretory
	proteins.  

Y-score (combined cleavage site score)
	The prediction of cleavage site location is optimized by
	observing where the C-score is high and the S-score changes from
	a high to a low value.  The Y-score formalizes this by combining
	the height of the C-score with the slope of the S-score. 

	Specifically, the Y-score is a geometric average between the
	C-score and a smoothed derivative of the S-score (i.e. the
	difference between the mean S-score over d positions before and
	d positions after the current position, where d varies with the
	chosen network ensemble). 

For each sequence, SignalP will report the maximal C-, S-, and Y-scores,
and the mean S-score between the N-terminal and the predicted cleavage
site.  These values are used to distinguish between signal peptides and
non-signal peptides.  If the your sequence is predicted to have a signal
peptide, the cleavage site is predicted to be immediately before the
position with the maximal Y-score. 


DATA:

The neural networks are trained on large data sets of signal peptide and
non-signal-peptide sequences derived from SWISS-PROT.  The data sets are
available by anonymous ftp from our ftp server:

	Host:      virus.cbs.dtu.dk
	login:     anonymous
	password:  <your e-mail address>
	directory: pub/signalp

The file README describes the data selection procedure and the format of
the data files.


WWW SERVER:

If you have access to a WWW browser that supports forms, it is faster
and more convenient to use the SignalP World Wide Web server at 

	http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/

for prediction of single sequences.  From the server you have access to
several pages of information about SignalP.


USAGE NOTES:

When interpreting the output from SignalP, you should be aware of the
following:

SignalP predicts *secretory* signal peptides
	In some contexts, target peptides for chloroplasts and
	mitochondria or peptides involved in intracellular signal
	transduction are referred to as "signal peptides". These are
	not similar to the signal peptides predicted by SignalP, which
	serve as signals for entering the secretory pathway.

Prokaryotic lipoprotein cleavage sites are not predicted 
	Some prokaryotic lipoproteins are cleaved by a specific
	lipoprotein signal peptidase, Lsp or signal peptidase II.  This
	peptidase recognizes a conserved sequence and cuts upstream of
	a cysteine residue to which a glyceride-fatty acid lipid is
	attached.  The cleavage sites of these proteins differ
	considerably from those cleaved by the standard prokaryotic
	signal peptidase (Lep).

	More information about prokaryotic lipoproteins and their
	consensus sequence can be found in the PROSITE entry
	PROKAR_LIPOPROTEIN (PDOC00013).  Sequences may be scanned for
	the occurence of PROSITE consensus patterns with the
	ScanProsite server
	(http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/scnpsit1.html).

Check the length of the predicted signal peptide 
	If SignalP predicts an abnormally short or long signal peptide,
	you should be aware that it might be a false prediction.  You
	can compare with the length distribution of our signal peptide
	data set (see
	http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/sp_lengths.html).

	Specifically, if SignalP predicts a eukaryotic signal peptide
	with a length over 30 residues, it might be uncleaved.  See the
	page about identification of signal anchors
	(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/signal_anchors.html).

Include position +1 in your sequence 
	The C- and Y-scores are trained to be maximal at position +1
	(immediately after the cleavage site).  If a submitted signal
	peptide sequence does not include position +1, the cleavage
	site will be invisible.  Therefore, if you want to submit a
	putative signal peptide alone (with none of the mature protein
	included), append at least one `X' to the C-terminal of your
	sequence.


PREDICTION ACCURACY:

The accuracy values given below are cross-validation *test* set values,
i.e. expected performances of the prediction method for sequences
without significant homology in the signal peptide region to any
sequences in the data sets used to train the neural networks.  Sequences
closely related to members of these data sets will have higher
probabilities for being predicted correctly.

-   Single position accuracy:

    When a cutoff value of 0.5 is used, the correlation coefficient for
    the single position assignments are:

            C score      S score        Y score
    euk        0.62         0.90           0.62 
    gram-      0.71         0.81           0.71 
    gram+      0.62         0.82           0.60 

-   Cleavage site location accuracy:

    When the cleavage site is placed at the position in the sequence
    where the score has maximal value, the percentage of sequences with
    correctly placed cleavage sites are:

	    C score         Y score
    euk     70 %            70 %
    gram-   78 %            79 %
    gram+   66 %            68 %

-   Sequence classification accuracy:

    The maximal values of the scores are used to predict whether the
    tested sequence has a signal peptide (i.e. is the start of a
    secretory protein) or no signal peptide  (i.e. is the start of a
    cytoplasmic or (in eukaryotes only) nuclear protein).  The
    correlation coefficients for this prediction are given below [with
    the corresponding optimal cutoff values given in brackets].

	    maximal         maximal         maximal         mean
	    C score         Y score         S score         S score
    euk     0.85 [0.37]     0.97 [0.34]     0.96 [0.88]     0.97 [0.48]
    gram-   0.71 [0.49]     0.89 [0.36]     0.82 [0.88]     0.88 [0.54]
    gram+   0.64 [0.42]     0.85 [0.34]     0.87 [0.95]     0.96 [0.55]

    "mean S score" is the average of the S score in the predicted signal
    peptide region, i.e. from position 1 to the position immediately
    before that where the Y score has maximal value.
