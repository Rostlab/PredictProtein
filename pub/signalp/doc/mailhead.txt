prediction of their cleavage sites."  
Protein Engineering, 10, 1-6, 1997


BRIEF EXPLANATION:

C-score (raw cleavage site score):
        The output score from networks trained to recognize cleavage
        sites vs. other sequence positions.  

S-score (signal peptide score)
        The output score from networks trained to recognize signal
        peptide vs. non-signal-peptide positions.  

Y-score (combined cleavage site score)
        The prediction of cleavage site location is optimized by
        observing where the C-score is high and the S-score changes from
        a high to a low value.  The Y-score formalizes this by combining
        the height of the C-score with the slope of the S-score.

Note:  The "cleavage site" position is defined as the position
immediately *after* the cleavage site, i.e. the first position in the
mature protein.  E.g., a predicted cleavage site at position 21
corresponds to a predicted signal peptide length of 20 amino acids.
