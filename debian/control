Description: A suite of sequence analysis tools
 PredictProtein is a sequence analysis suite providing prediction of protein
 structure and function. It takes protein sequences or alignments as input
 and provides the following per-residue or whole protein annotations: multiple
 sequence alignments, PROSITE sequence motifs, low-complexity regions, nuclear
 localisation signals, regions lacking regular structure (NORS), secondary
 structure, solvent accessibility, globular regions, transmembrane helices,
 coiled-coil regions, structural switch regions, disulfide-bonds, sub-cellular
 localization, disordered regions, B-value flexibility, protein-protein
 interaction sites and protein-DNA interaction sites. Upon request fold
 recognition by prediction-based threading, predictions of transmembrane
 strands and inter-residue contacts are also available. 
 .
 tmhmm (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?tmhmm) is non-
 redistributable.  Please obtain your own version and configure
 predictprotein accordingly.
 .
 loctree depends on SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) that
 is non-redistributable.  Please obtain your own version and configure
 predictprotein accordingly.
